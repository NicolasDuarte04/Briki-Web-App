# GitHub Setup Guide for Briki Insurance Platform

Since there's a Git configuration issue, here are multiple ways to get your code on GitHub:

## Method 1: Download Project Files (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project
Your project is ready with these key files:
- README.md (comprehensive documentation)
- .gitignore (protects sensitive files)
- .env.example (environment variable template)
- Complete source code with recent plan visualization fixes

### Step 2: Download Files
1. In Replit, go to the file explorer
2. Click the three dots menu (⋯) next to your project name
3. Select "Download as zip"
4. Save the zip file to your computer

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to github.com and create a new repository
2. Name it "briki-insurance-platform"
3. Don't initialize with README (we have one)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 4: Upload Files
1. Extract the downloaded zip file
2. Remove any `.replit` or `replit.nix` files if present
3. In your GitHub repository, click "uploading an existing file"
4. Drag and drop all project files
5. Write commit message: "Initial commit: AI-powered insurance platform"
6. Click "Commit changes"

## Method 2: GitHub CLI (Alternative)

If you have GitHub CLI installed locally:
```bash
gh repo create briki-insurance-platform --public
# Then upload files manually through GitHub web interface
```

## Method 3: Direct File Creation

Create files directly in GitHub:
1. Create new repository on GitHub
2. Use "Create new file" to add each important file
3. Copy content from your Replit files

## Project Structure Overview

Your project includes:
```
