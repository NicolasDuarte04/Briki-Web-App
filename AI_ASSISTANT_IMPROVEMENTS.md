# 🚀 Briki AI Assistant Improvements Summary

## Date: January 2, 2025

### Overview
Implemented 5 key improvements to fix duplicate plans, category contamination, missing context chip, and improve plan filtering based on production feedback.

---

## ✅ Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Duplicate Plan Prevention** ✅
**Problem**: Plans were shown multiple times after follow-up questions.

**Solution**:
- Added `shownPlanIds` state tracking in `NewBrikiAssistant.tsx`
- Filters out already-shown plans before rendering
- Tracks plan IDs across the entire conversation
- Clears tracking on conversation reset

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// NewBrikiAssistant.tsx
const [shownPlanIds, setShownPlanIds] = useState<Set<number>>(new Set());

// Filter duplicate plans
const newPlans = finalSuggestedPlans.filter(plan => !shownPlanIds.has(plan.id));
```

---

### 2. **Category Contamination Fix** ✅
**Problem**: MAPFRE pet insurance shown when user asked for MAPFRE auto insurance.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `findRelevantPlans()` to enforce strict category locking
- Added provider-category validation
- Returns empty array if provider has no plans in current category
- Assistant now explains when provider doesn't offer plans in requested category

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// openai-service.ts - findRelevantPlans()
if (preferredProviders.length > 0) {
  const providerPlans = categoryPlans.filter(plan => 
    preferredProviders.some(provider => 
      plan.provider.toLowerCase().includes(provider.toLowerCase())
    )
  );
  
  if (providerPlans.length === 0) {
    // Log and return empty - let assistant explain
    return [];
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **Enhanced Context Summary Chip** ✅
**Problem**: No visual indication of detected context and collected information.

**Solution**:
- Added beautiful gradient context chip with icons
- Shows detected category in blue
- Shows missing info in orange
- Shows collected context in green
- Dynamically builds summary based on category

**Visual Example**:
```
🔵 Detectado: auto | 🟠 Falta: location | 🟢 Kia Picanto 2020
```

---

### 4. **Intelligent Provider Handling** ✅
**Problem**: Assistant didn't explain when requested provider had no plans in category.

**Solution**:
- Updated system prompt with provider-specific logic
- Assistant now explains: "No tengo planes de auto de MAPFRE"
- Suggests switching categories if provider offers other insurance types
- Never shows wrong-category plans without user consent

---

### 5. **Improved Plan Filtering** ✅
**Problem**: Plans not well-sorted, SURA always shown first.

**Solution**:
- Plans now filtered by detected category first
- Provider preferences respected when available
- Price range filtering maintained
- Maximum 4 plans shown by default

---
