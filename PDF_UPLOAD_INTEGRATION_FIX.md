# PDF Upload + Send Integration Fix

## 🎯 Problem Fixed
The PDF upload feature was not integrated with the send button. When users selected a PDF and wrote a message, clicking Send would only send the message, leaving the PDF unprocessed.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **FileUpload Component Enhancement** (`FileUpload.tsx`)
- Added support for controlled component pattern
- New props: `onFileChange` and `selectedFile` for external state management
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `onFileSelect` prop

### 2. **Chat Logic Hook Update** (`useChatLogic.ts`)
- Added `pendingFile` state to track selected but not yet uploaded files
- New method `sendMessageWithDocument` that handles both text and file together
- Proper cleanup: clears both input and file after sending

### 3. **BrikiAssistant Component Integration** (`BrikiAssistant.tsx`)
- Uses controlled FileUpload with `pendingFile` state
- Send button now calls `sendMessageWithDocument` instead of just `sendMessage`
- Button is enabled when either text or file is present (or both)
- Files are held in state until send, not uploaded immediately

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to `/ask-briki-ai`
2. Click "Subir documento" and select a PDF
3. Type a message like "¿Me puedes resumir esta póliza por favor?"
4. Click the blue Send button

### Expected Behavior:
- ✓ Document uploads first (loading indicator)
- ✓ Document summary appears in chat
- ✓ User message appears after
- ✓ Assistant responds appropriately
- ✓ Both inputs are cleared

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Key Changes:
```typescript
// FileUpload.tsx - Now supports controlled mode
<FileUpload 
  onFileChange={handleFileChange}
  selectedFile={pendingFile}
  isUploading={isUploadingDocument}
/>

// useChatLogic.ts - Unified send method
const sendMessageWithDocument = async (messageText?: string, file?: File | null) => {
  // Upload document first if provided
  if (fileToUpload) {
    await handleDocumentUpload(fileToUpload);
  }
  // Then send message if provided
  if (textToSend?.trim()) {
    await sendMessage(textToSend);
  }
};

// BrikiAssistant.tsx - Updated send button
<Button
  type="submit"
  disabled={(!input.trim() && !pendingFile) || isTyping || isUploadingDocument}
  onClick={sendMessageWithDocument}
>
```

## 📝 Notes
- The fix maintains all existing functionality
- Error handling remains intact
- Loading states work for both upload and message processing
- Mobile and desktop layouts both updated
