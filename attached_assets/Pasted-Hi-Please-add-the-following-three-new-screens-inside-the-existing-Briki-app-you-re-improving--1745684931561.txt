Hi! Please add the following three new screens inside the existing Briki app you’re improving:

⸻

	1.	Learn More Section:
Create a new screen called LearnMoreScreen.
Write a short, user-friendly explanation of Briki’s purpose:

	•	Briki lets users easily compare and purchase travel insurance from top providers.
	•	Focus on Briki’s speed (find insurance in under 2 minutes), simplicity, and trusted partnerships.
	•	Highlight convenience, transparency, and security through Stripe payment.
	•	Tone must be professional but welcoming and confident.

Add a button linking to this screen from the Home screen (“Learn More about Briki”).

⸻

	2.	Terms and Services Section:
Create a screen called TermsScreen.
Write a basic but professional Terms and Services text. Cover:

	•	User obligations (respect app rules, valid information)
	•	Limitation of liability (Briki is not the insurer)
	•	No warranty clause (plans depend on providers)
	•	Purchase agreements (plans sold by third-party insurers)
	•	Refund policy (subject to each insurer’s terms)
	•	Intellectual property (Briki app and branding protected)
	•	Governing law: Colombia and Mexico

Make it understandable, legally solid, and friendly.

Add a footer link to “Terms and Services” from the Home screen.

⸻

	3.	Disclaimer Section (Updated for Trustworthiness):
Create a screen called DisclaimerScreen.
Do NOT make it sound like Briki is untrustworthy.
Instead, emphasize:

	•	Briki responsibly curates plan information from official public sources and trusted partnerships.
	•	Briki simplifies and empowers the insurance-buying process.
	•	Coverage terms are displayed transparently for user convenience.
	•	Final insurance documents are issued securely by the selected provider.

Tone: Trust-building, empowering, professional, and easy to understand.

Add a footer link to “Disclaimer” from the Home screen.

⸻

Design Requirements:
	•	Match the Briki app’s current visual style (fonts, colors, button margins).
	•	Keep new screens mobile-optimized and easy to scroll.
	•	Use simple navigation — Home → Learn More / Terms / Disclaimer.

Thank you!
