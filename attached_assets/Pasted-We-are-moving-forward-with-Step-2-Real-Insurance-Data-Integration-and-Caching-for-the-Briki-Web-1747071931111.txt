We are moving forward with **Step 2: Real Insurance Data Integration and Caching** for the Briki Web Application. I need you to complete the following tasks:

---

### üåü **1Ô∏è‚É£ API Connection for All Providers**  
**Objective:** Connect all 12 insurance providers to the platform.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Establish real-time API connections for the 12 insurance providers.  
2. Replace mock data with live API data.  
3. Ensure proper authentication and secure connections for all API requests.  

---

### üåü **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Validation & Normalization**  
**Objective:** Ensure consistent and reliable data across all providers.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Validate incoming data to prevent display errors or broken elements.  
2. Normalize data from different providers to match the internal schema.  
3. Handle any discrepancies in data structure gracefully.  

---

### üåü **3Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling**  
**Objective:** Improve user experience during API failures or connection issues.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Implement user-friendly error messages when an API call fails.  
2. Create fallbacks that display alternative content or retry logic.  
3. Monitor for API rate limits and handle gracefully.  

---

### üåü **4Ô∏è‚É£ Caching Mechanism**  
**Objective:** Speed up data retrieval and improve the user experience.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Integrate **React Query** or an equivalent caching mechanism for faster access.  
2. Apply cache invalidation logic when the user interacts with filters or refreshes the page.  
3. Optimize loading times for frequently accessed data.  

---

### üåü **5Ô∏è‚É£ Loading States & Skeleton Screens**  
**Objective:** Enhance UX during data fetch.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Integrate smooth loading indicators for data fetching.  
2. Use skeleton loaders to prevent blank screens while waiting for responses.  
3. Ensure consistency in loading animations across all major screens.  

---

### **Expected Deliverables:**  
- Full API integration with real data from all 12 providers.  
- Consistent and validated data displayed in the UI.  
- Graceful error handling with proper user feedback.  
- Caching mechanism to optimize load times.  
- Smooth loading screens to avoid blank screens.  

Please provide a report of:  
- Which APIs were connected and verified.  
- How caching and data normalization were implemented.  
- Screenshots of the final data displays and error handling.  

If there are any blockers or issues, please provide a detailed explanation so we can resolve them quickly.
