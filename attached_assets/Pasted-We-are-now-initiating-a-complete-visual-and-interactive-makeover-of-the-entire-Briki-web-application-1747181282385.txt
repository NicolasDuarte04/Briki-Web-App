We are now initiating a complete visual and interactive makeover of the entire Briki web application. This is not a restructuring of logic or flow—it is a full redesign of every existing screen to match our final vision of a high-end, AI-powered, multi-insurance category platform. Think of this as “rebuilding a mansion from the foundation we already laid.” Every page and feature should remain, but the design, UI components, and interactions should be fully transformed. Follow this prompt exactly:

GENERAL VISION
- Final look and feel should resemble a fusion between **Stripe**, **Apple Design**, and **AI-first products like Notion AI**.
- Use a **brighter, more intelligent color scheme**, not flat or corporate—but dynamic, polished, and engaging.
- Integrate **AI-generated gradients**, moving liquid backgrounds, animated floating elements, and intelligent layout spacing.
- Preserve current functionality but modernize all **inputs, buttons, cards, plan layouts, charts**, and **Briki Pilot (Assistant)**.
- All improvements should respect mobile-first responsiveness and high accessibility standards.

VISUAL STYLE GUIDE
1. **Color Palette**:
   - Primary: #4C6EFF and its gradient range (#4C6EFF to #5F9FFF)
   - Accent: Add vibrant tones like soft electric aqua, subtle purples, and warm blue glows (see Stripe inspiration)
   - Dark text: Use deep navy or softened dark gray, not pure black
   - Background: Use **animated radial or linear gradients**—animated, soft, with natural liquid movement
2. **Typography**:
   - Use clean, modern fonts like **Inter** or **DM Sans**
   - Implement hierarchy: Large bold headings, mid-weight subheaders, readable body text
3. **Component Design**:
   - Buttons: Animated hover + ripple, Apple/Stripe-style glass-morph edges, curved corners
   - Cards: Floating cards with depth, hover scaling, better shadow layering
   - Forms: Modern with field glow/focus, built-in validation feedback, clean spacing

EXISTING SCREENS TO TRANSFORM (DO NOT DELETE ANY):
- Home Landing Page with Countdown (Keep Timer logic but redesign visually)
- Login / Register Screens (Add animated liquid background, modern UI box styling)
- Plan Selection + Plan Comparison Pages (cards, toggles, data visualizations)
- Briki Pilot Chat / Assistant Interface (new design for co-pilot, embedded bubble, better UI/UX logic)
- All Category Pages (Auto, Travel, Pet, Health) must be redesigned under this new style
- Confirmation, Toast, and Notice Modals (refine, glass-morph, animate in/out)
- Navigation bar + footer must be restructured to match final polish

BRIKI PILOT REDESIGN
- Design Briki Pilot like a floating AI assistant (Think: Apple’s Vision Pro + Claude AI UI bubble)
- Only activates on click (no auto-popup)
- Add floating animation when idle
- Briki Pilot must match futuristic but friendly aesthetic

ADDITIONAL NOTES
- The **launch countdown timer** on the home screen must stay visible, but integrated naturally with the new visual style (centered in a hero section with background movement)
- All current routes, links, and authentication must be preserved (DO NOT break any navigation)
- Add refined micro-interactions for every button, hover state, toast, etc.
- Maintain dark/light mode compatibility if previously present

INSPIRATION REFERENCES:
- Stripe Homepage (https://stripe.com)
- Apple Developer UI
- Notion AI & Linear.app
- You already received visual references previously uploaded (gradient, stripe, animations)

DELIVERY FORMAT
- No new screens or file restructuring—just visual + styling updates
- Use a systematic update strategy: Home screen → Login/Signup → Plan Cards → Compare Plans → Briki Assistant → Others
- For every section, use reusable CSS or component system logic where possible

We expect a dramatic shift in visual polish while keeping everything functional and ready for public beta launch. Let me know once the first screen is reworked and deployed so we can iterate live.
