We are updating the Briki landing page to highlight our newest feature: the **Briki AI Assistant** — a fully integrated, intelligent guide that helps users understand, compare, and purchase insurance in seconds.

### Key Changes to Implement:

1. **Add a New Hero Subsection (Below Main Hero or as Slide 2)**
   - Title: **Meet Briki AI Assistant**
   - Subtitle: *Your personal insurance guide — built with real intelligence.*
   - Include a visual mockup of the assistant screen (or animated demo)
   - Add a CTA button: **Try the Assistant**

2. **Create a Dedicated Feature Section**
   - Section Title: **Built-in AI That Makes Insurance Easy**
   - Use a clean three-column layout to highlight core capabilities:
     • **Explain Any Term**  
       *“What’s a deductible?” — Briki explains in plain language.*
     • **Recommend the Right Plan**  
       *Tell Briki your needs, and it finds your best fit instantly.*
     • **Navigate for You**  
       *Briki can launch quotes, compare options, and show you only what matters.*

3. **Insert a Highlight Banner or Trust Badge**
   - Banner Text: *“Briki AI is powered by OpenAI and tailored by insurance experts.”*
   - Add a small OpenAI logo or a “Powered by AI” gradient badge

4. **Update the Features Overview (Optional Cards or Icons)**
   - Add “AI-Powered Assistant” as a feature icon alongside others like “Real-Time Quotes” and “Multi-Company Comparison”

5. **(Optional) Add a Short Demo Reel or Animated UI Preview**
   - Short 10-15s loop showing a user asking:  
     *“I want to insure my 8-year-old dog with diabetes” → Assistant replies + shows plans*
   - Embed this in the Assistant section or open it in a modal

6. **SEO & Meta Description**
   - Update site metadata and page title:
     > *Briki – AI-Powered Insurance Comparison for Travel, Pet, Health & Auto*
     > *Now with Briki AI Assistant — understand your options, instantly.*
