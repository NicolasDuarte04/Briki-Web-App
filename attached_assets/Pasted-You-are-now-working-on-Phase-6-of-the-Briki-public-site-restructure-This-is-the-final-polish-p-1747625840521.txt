You are now working on **Phase 6 of the Briki public site restructure**.

This is the final polish phase before launch. The goal is to ensure the public pages are fully accessible, performant, and production-ready from a front-end perspective. This includes auditing for Lighthouse scores, responsive behavior, and semantic HTML.

### Objectives:

1. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Ensure all buttons, links, and inputs have accessible labels
   - Add `aria-labels` where needed
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works on all taskbar items, CTAs, and inputs
   - Use semantic HTML tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, etc.) in all public screens

2. **Responsive Design QA**
   - Check each public screen on mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes
   - Ensure no layout breaking occurs
   - Adjust Tailwind breakpoints if needed to preserve alignment and readability

3. **Lighthouse Audit & Performance**
   - Run Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools) on all public routes:
     • `/`
     • `/features`
     • `/pricing`
     • `/ask-briki`
     • `/blog`
     • `/forum`
     • `/careers`
   - Ensure scores are:
     • Performance: 90+
     • Accessibility: 95+
     • Best Practices: 90+
     • SEO: 90+
   - Optimize large images or animations if needed
   - Defer any unnecessary JavaScript and eliminate unused CSS (if detected)

4. **Meta Tags & SEO Validation**
   - Make sure each page has:
     • Unique meta title
     • Meta description
     • Proper Open Graph tags (optional but recommended)
   - Confirm that `<title>` tags match the visual H1 headers

5. **Deployment Checklist**
   - Check favicon, logo scaling, 404 fallback
   - Validate all routes return expected pages
   - Ensure no authenticated-only routes are accessible without login

Once this is complete, the Briki public site is ready for production deployment.

After this phase, we will start a **new parallel flow** to polish the **post-login experience (dashboard, compare, assistant, quote flow)** — built with the same precision and consistency.
