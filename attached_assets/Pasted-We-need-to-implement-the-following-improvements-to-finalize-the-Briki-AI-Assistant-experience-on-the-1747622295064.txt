We need to implement the following improvements to finalize the Briki AI Assistant experience on the landing page and fix UX/navigation issues:

---

### 1. Replace Assistant Demo with Real, Compelling Interaction
- Remove the default “Hi! I’m Briki…” greeting and the repeated error response
- Replace it with a **two-turn assistant conversation** that showcases value and intelligence:
  Example:

  > **User:** I’m freelance and need health insurance that covers emergencies and checkups.  
  > **Briki AI:** Great — I found two flexible plans that include ER visits, virtual care, and no long-term contracts. Want to see them?

- Make sure this demo interaction:
  • Uses proper spacing between messages  
  • Has animated typing dots after the user’s message (before the assistant responds)  
  • Shows one card below for “Plan A – FlexHealth Basic” (can be mocked visually)

---

### 2. Fix the Taskbar/Header Overlap Bug
- Currently, there are **two taskbars**, and they cause overlapping elements:
  • One sticky while navigating  
  • One that fades in when inactive

- **Fix:**
  • Remove or disable the sticky “active” navigation bar  
  • Leave only the pop-in header bar (the one that appears when scrolling up or returning to top)  
  • Make sure the single header remains clean, doesn’t clash with hero content, and doesn’t obscure UI when scrolling

---

### 3. Make Input Bar Static (Not Floating or Shifting)
- Right now, the input field shifts with the chat and is not anchored

- **Fix:**
  • Set the input bar to be **anchored to the bottom of the assistant container**, regardless of message overflow
  • Use a layout that prevents scroll push-up
  • Ensure the input bar does NOT move up/down with incoming responses — only the message area should scroll

---

### 4. Fix API Connection for OpenAI Assistant
- Assistant currently does not return responses and only triggers fallback error (“I apologize…”)

- **Fix:**
  • Check if the frontend is properly connected to the backend route `/api/ai/ask`
  • Confirm that the OpenAI key is live and server-side only
  • Ensure system prompt and user input are correctly passed in the API payload

---

### 5. Minor UX Polishing
- Use the Briki color palette consistently for all bubble backgrounds  
- Smoothen transitions between assistant state changes (e.g. typing, loading, reply, card render)  
- Use a custom assistant icon/avatar instead of the default blue robot

---

Please complete all fixes above and confirm once implemented. We want to finalize the Briki AI section for production readiness with clean layout, realistic functionality, and no broken navigation.
