We’re updating the Briki AI Assistant demo card on the landing page to make it look cleaner, more polished, and better aligned with our design system. The “Meet Briki AI Assistant” header section looks great — this task is focused only on improving the visual and UX quality of the assistant preview box shown underneath.

---

### Objectives:

1. **Visual Improvements – Header & Colors**
   - Update the blue header (`Briki AI Assistant`) to use a **lighter gradient** consistent with our primary brand color (`#4C6EFF` or `--gradient-primary`)
   - Improve **contrast** between the background and text in both the header and the message bubbles
   - Adjust the **user message background**:
     • From: dark blue
     • To: lighter background (e.g., `bg-blue-100 text-blue-900` for better readability)
   - Add a soft **card shadow or border** to make the assistant card pop on white backgrounds

2. **Spacing & Layout Fixes**
   - Add more vertical space between message bubbles (use `space-y-2` or `mb-4`)
   - Ensure even **padding inside the card**, especially between the final assistant response and the message input area
   - Ensure all message bubbles have **consistent border radius** and visual balance

3. **Replace the Example Chat Conversation**
   - Replace the current example (“I want to insure my 9-year-old dog with arthritis”) with a **more professional, universal use case**:

   Example to use:
   > **User:** I’m flying to Spain for 3 weeks. What’s the best travel insurance in case I need medical care abroad?  
   > **Briki AI:** I’ve found a few plans that include emergency medical coverage and trip cancellation protection. Here’s a good one to start with:  
   > • *GlobalSecure Travel Protection*

   - Update the assistant response and plan mention to fit the new context
   - Display 1 recommendation only for visual clarity

4. **Add Realism / Trust Details**
   - Add a **typing preview indicator** after the user message (e.g., “Briki is typing…” or animated dots)
   - Use a **custom assistant avatar icon** (not a generic robot head) that reflects Briki’s brand
   - Make the message flow appear staggered or progressive (optional fade-in or slide animation)

5. **Ensure Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Check alignment and wrapping on smaller screens
   - Ensure no overlapping or text collisions occur at any breakpoint

This card should look clean, high-trust, and realistic — giving users a glimpse of how helpful Briki really is. Keep all changes aligned with our current Tailwind + ShadCN UI system.
