Hi! I’ve noticed that while the visual design of our insurance category pages (Travel, Auto, Pet, Health) is looking great, there’s a key part of the user journey that seems to be missing: **functional quote entry flows** for each category.

Right now, users don’t seem to be able to input their specific information (like trip details for travel insurance) before being shown the plans. That makes the experience feel disconnected and makes the filtering logic ineffective.

Can you help clarify the following so we can correct this?

---

### 1. Current Category Page Logic
- What happens technically when a user visits `/insurance/travel` (or similar)?
- Is there any current form-handling logic that collects user details before showing plans?
- Are we using a shared component to load plans regardless of category?
- Is the system currently filtering plans based on any user input?

---

### 2. Quote Input Screens
- Do we have any form components in the repo that are meant to collect:
  - Travel insurance trip details?
  - Auto vehicle info?
  - Pet profile info?
  - Health profile data?

- If so, where are these currently located? (Are they wired up to the flow?)

- Are these screens conditionally rendered inside the `/insurance/[category].tsx` pages or routed externally (e.g., `/get-quote`)?

---

### 3. Data Persistence
- How is user input currently being stored after being entered in quote flows?
- Do we have a quoteContext or Zustand store handling this logic?
- Is there any existing logic that filters plans based on the captured quote data?

### 4. Next Steps for Fix
If we want to implement the correct flow:
1. Each category page should include a CTA like **“Enter Trip Details and Get Quotes”** or the category-specific equivalent.
2. This should lead to a dedicated quote input form screen per category.
3. Once submitted, users should be redirected to a filtered list of relevant plans.

Can you confirm if this architecture is partially built or needs to be implemented from scratch?

Once we know the answers, we’ll define the new flow and UI/UX properly. Thank you!
