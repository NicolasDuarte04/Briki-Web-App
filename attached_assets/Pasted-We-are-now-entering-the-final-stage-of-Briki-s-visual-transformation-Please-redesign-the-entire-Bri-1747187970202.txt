We are now entering the final stage of Briki’s visual transformation. Please redesign the entire Briki application using Apple Human Interface Guidelines and Stripe-like UI quality as visual references. Use the gradient aesthetic and clean font layout from the image provided. DO NOT delete any screen—this is a visual and UX transformation, not a reset of routes or logic.

---

### 1. VISUAL STYLE
- Use a bold gradient background for the hero section (like the provided image) and gentle blurred gradients or soft light backgrounds for inner sections.
- Use Apple-style typography: clean, legible, high-contrast. Headings should use semibold sans-serif fonts. Body text should be neutral but readable.
- All cards and buttons must include:
  - Micro-interactions
  - Glassmorphism/light frosted blur effects
  - Shadows and soft hover states
- Input fields must follow macOS/iOS standards with clean borders, full width, and perfect focus states.

### 2. GLOBAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM (Desktop and Mobile):
Rebuild the navigation bar as follows:
- **Logo (top-left)**: Briki (as image or text)
- **Links (center)**:
  - Home
  - Travel Insurance
  - Auto Insurance
  - Pet Insurance
  - Health Insurance
  - For Companies (Dropdown with options: “Join as Partner”, “Dashboard Login”)
- **Buttons (top-right)**:
  - Sign In
  - Sign Up (Highlighted CTA)
- **Mobile Navigation**: Collapsible hamburger menu with same links in vertical order. Animations must follow Apple-style motion.
