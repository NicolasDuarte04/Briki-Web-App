You are now working on **Phase 7** of the Briki AI Assistant development.

This phase enables the assistant to **control parts of the app** by interpreting user intent and triggering navigation or state changes — such as opening quote flows, setting filters, or auto-filling known fields.

---

### Objectives:

1. **Define Assistant Action Types**
   - Expand your structured AI responses to include new `type` values that trigger navigation:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "navigate_to_quote_flow",
       "category": "pet",
       "preload": {
         "age": 8,
         "preexisting_conditions": ["cancer"]
       },
       "message": "Let’s start building a pet insurance quote based on your dog’s needs."
     }
     ```
   - Supported `type` values:
     • `navigate_to_quote_flow`
     • `open_comparison_tool`
     • `filter_plan_results`
     • `show_glossary_term`
     • `redirect_to_account_settings` (for future personalization)

2. **Add a Frontend Action Dispatcher**
   - Create a helper function to interpret the assistant response and dispatch UI actions
   - For `navigate_to_quote_flow`, use:
     • `useNavigation` to push the correct quote flow screen (e.g., `/quote/pet`)
     • Pass `preload` data via global state, URL params, or context

3. **Trigger Navigation Smoothly**
   - When the assistant response contains an actionable intent:
     • First display the message as part of chat history
     • Then show a confirmation (e.g., “Taking you to your quote now…”)
     • Then execute the navigation or UI update
   - Use loading indicators or toasts to signal activity

4. **Protect From Bad Inputs**
   - If the assistant response contains malformed or unsupported actions:
     • Ignore and show a fallback message: “I couldn’t complete that action, but here’s what I can help with…”

5. **Track Assistant Actions (Optional Analytics Prep)**
   - Add optional internal logging (e.g., console.log or mock analytics event) for actions triggered via the assistant
   - This will help inform future analytics in Phase 9

This phase transforms Briki into an **interactive, semi-autonomous assistant** that actually moves the user through the app — the foundation of true product-led AI navigation.

Once complete, we’ll move to **Phase 8: Glossary + Visual Explainers Component Library**.
