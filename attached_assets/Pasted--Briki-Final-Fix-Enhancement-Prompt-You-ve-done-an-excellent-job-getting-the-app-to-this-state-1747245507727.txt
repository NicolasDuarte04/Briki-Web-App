**Briki Final Fix & Enhancement Prompt**

You’ve done an excellent job getting the app to this state — the new landing page looks incredible. We now want to finalize the Briki pre-launch build by addressing some final bugs and making structural and styling fixes across the app. Below is a breakdown of everything we need:

---

### ✅ WHAT'S WORKING (Do not change):
- **Landing page visuals**: Hero gradient, layout, timer, and section spacing are excellent — leave as is.
- **Countdown component**: Its style, placement, and logic are perfect.
- **Teal/Navy color usage on landing page**: Great color blending. Use this as reference for consistency.
- **Briki Pilot dashboard & upload screens**: These screens look great and should not be touched, except for the fixes listed below.

---

### ⚠️ WHAT TO FIX:

#### 1. Universal Header Refactor (Main App Only)
- Create a **single shared layout component** for the B2C user-facing part of the app.
- Replace all per-screen headers with this universal header component.
- Ensure this header supports **scroll behavior** (e.g. transparent at top, solid on scroll).
- Fix all current issues with **duplicate navbars**, **overlapping items**, and **slow render transitions** on navigation.
- **Important**: Do **not** apply this to Briki Pilot screens — they have their own layout system.

#### 2. Auth Screen Input Bug (First Key Ignored)
- Fix the sign-in/sign-up issue where the first character typed in inputs gets ignored.
- Likely caused by delayed binding in controlled inputs — ensure state is initialized before user can type.
- Suggested fix: `useEffect` to confirm proper input state mounting.

#### 3. Excessive Blank Space in Auth Screens
- Reduce the excessive vertical white space around the login/register boxes.
- Consider reusing the soft gradient or light blur effect seen on the landing page for visual polish.

#### 4. Preview Screen Crash in Briki Pilot
- Fix the error on the `/company-dashboard/preview` route:
  - `TabsContent must be used within Tabs`
- Implement the full `<Tabs>` and `<TabsContent>` hierarchy per shadcn/ui or relevant library.

#### 5. Typography Contrast Issue (B2B Section)
- On the teal/navy section (`Insurance Companies: Supercharge Your Distribution`), the **"Supercharge Your Distribution"** line uses a black font that blends into the background.
- Fix by using a **lighter color** (e.g. `text-white`, or a semi-glowing blue like `#F2F8FF`).

#### 6. CTA Button Contrast – "Register as Partner"
- On the B2B landing section, the "Register as Partner" button appears too faded.
- Adjust font weight or background color to increase visibility without breaking the current design aesthetic.

#### 7. Color Theme Consistency Across Pages
- Remove all remaining **purple tones** from the app (except in Briki Pilot if intentional).
- Apply the same **teal-to-navy blue** palette used in the landing page across all B2C screens.
- Centralize the theme using `tailwind.config.js` or the `/config.ts` file.

#### 8. Animation Conflicts on Page Transitions
- Reduce redundant animations between `Framer Motion`, `PageTransition`, and `transition-effect`.
- Ensure only **one animation system** governs page load/exit transitions per screen.
- Fix flickers or visual jumpiness that occur when navigating across screens.

---

### OPTIONAL POLISH (only if time permits)
- Ensure all typography (headers, buttons, descriptions) follows a consistent scale and font weight.
- Review mobile responsiveness of sign-in/sign-up screens for improved vertical spacing.
