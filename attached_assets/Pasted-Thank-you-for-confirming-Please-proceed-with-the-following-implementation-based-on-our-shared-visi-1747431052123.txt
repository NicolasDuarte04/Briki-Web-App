Thank you for confirming. Please proceed with the following implementation, based on our shared vision for Briki:

---

### **Briki – Final Comparison Tool Feature Scope**

This is the full set of features and behaviors we want to implement in the comparison system, ensuring it becomes a fully functional, production-ready module:

---

### 1. **Dedicated `/compare-plans` Screen**
- Replace the modal-based comparison flow with a fully responsive standalone screen.
- The new route will serve as the default comparison environment for all insurance categories.

---

### 2. **Global Plan Selection (Zustand + Persistence)**
- Use Zustand with `persist` middleware to maintain selected plans across:
  - Page refreshes
  - App navigation
  - Session reloads
- Store: `/store/compare-store.ts`
- State: `selectedPlans: { id, category }[]`

---

### 3. **Confirmation Dialog on Clear**
- Implement a `Dialog` component when users:
  - Press “Clear Comparison”
  - Try to leave `/compare-plans` with active selections
- Use shadcn UI’s dialog pattern for visual consistency

---

### 4. **Plan Limit + UX Guidance**
- Set a soft limit of 4 plans in the comparison state
- If exceeded:
  - Show a tooltip or toast warning (not a blocker)
  - Highlight UI to discourage comparing more than 4 at once

---

### 5. **Plan Loading from Any Context**
- Ensure that if a user visits `/compare-plans` directly:
  - Plan data for selected IDs is still loaded
  - This works even if the user hasn’t visited the insurance category pages
- Can use fallback lazy fetching or plan metadata caching

---

### 6. **Analytics Integration**
- Log compare events using the existing tracking setup:
  - View comparison
  - Add/remove plan from comparison
  - Click to compare
- Optional: integrate a separate analytics layer (Google Analytics, etc.)

---

### 7. **High-Quality UX**
- Maintain the responsive layout and styling from existing components
- Support full scroll, mobile friendliness, and dark/light compatibility

---

### 8. **Scalability for Licensing**
- Modularize the comparison logic so we can:
  - Reuse the code for other clients
  - Extract into an embeddable component if needed
  - Adapt for other datasets and insurance APIs later

---

### Deployment Notes:
- This module will become a key asset for potential business deals and tech licensing
- Please ensure the system is stable, scalable, and easy to maintain

Please confirm this scope and let us know once implementation begins.
