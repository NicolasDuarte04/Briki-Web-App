Hey! Iâ€™d like to initiate a complete and functional implementation of the Briki Blog module, based on the current mock version we have in production.

ðŸ“¸ Context:

As you can see from the latest screenshots:
	â€¢	The current blog UI is static and purely placeholder content.
	â€¢	Clicking on any article leads to a 404 Page Not Found.
	â€¢	Thereâ€™s no CMS or dynamic structure supporting article creation or publishing.
	â€¢	Visually, the design feels a bit bland and lacks customization options or visual variety.

â¸»

âœ… Objectives:

1. Make the Blog Fully Functional
	â€¢	Enable actual blog article creation, editing, and publishing.
	â€¢	Articles should be stored either in a CMS, database, or structured JSON file system.
	â€¢	Set up dynamic routes for articles (e.g. /blog/understanding-travel-insurance).
	â€¢	Implement proper slug generation and error handling for missing articles.

2. Implement a Blog Admin CMS (Basic)
	â€¢	Temporary admin dashboard or markdown-based system for uploading/editing articles.
	â€¢	Optional: Use an MDX-based content structure or connect to an external CMS like Sanity/Contentful/Notion API.

3. Improve UI/UX
	â€¢	Introduce dynamic tags, categories, and filterable article listings.
	â€¢	Add real-time reading time estimate, featured article flag, and publication date.
	â€¢	Redesign the article cards for more visual variation (images, color accents, hover effects).
	â€¢	Ensure full mobile responsiveness.

ðŸ’» Tech Requirements:
	â€¢	Use /pages/blog/index.tsx as the main article listing page
	â€¢	Create dynamic route /pages/blog/[slug].tsx for individual articles
	â€¢	Add a new data source (or database table) to store blog content
	â€¢	Consider a WYSIWYG editor or simple markdown parser for internal team use

ðŸ›  Questions:

Before we proceed, could you confirm:
	1.	Are we currently using any blog/CMS solution or is everything static right now?
	2.	Do you suggest using an in-house markdown file system or an external CMS (like Sanity or Notion API)?
	3.	Would you prefer the articles to be editable via an admin panel or simply via commits to a markdown-based repo?
	4.	Are there any reusable components or blog-related code already in place (even commented out)?
	5.	Do we want comments, likes, or social share features from day one?
	6.	What visual improvements do you recommend to better match Brikiâ€™s vibrant brand?

Once you reply to these points and give the green light, Iâ€™ll follow up with a technical plan for implementing the live blog system with CMS and publishing workflow.

Letâ€™s make the blog amazing!
