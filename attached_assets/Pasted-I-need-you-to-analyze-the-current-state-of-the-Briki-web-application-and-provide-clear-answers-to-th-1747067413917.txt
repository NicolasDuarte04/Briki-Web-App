I need you to analyze the current state of the Briki web application and provide clear answers to the following questions. We are preparing to complete Phase 1 of the project, which includes a Futuristic UI Transition, Real Insurance Data Integration, and Stripe Payment Integration. Please provide detailed and structured answers:

üåü Phase 1: UI, Data, and Payment Integration

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Futuristic UI Transition**
   - Is the current UI across all screens fully optimized for dark theme?  
   - Are there any inconsistencies between the Trip Info screen, Plan Comparison, and Checkout flows?  
   - Is the AI assistant already implemented? If yes, where and how is it functioning? If not, what is missing?  
   - Are the dropdowns, input fields, and navigational elements consistent and responsive?  
   - Are all visual elements (buttons, icons, forms) aligned with the modern futuristic theme we want to achieve?

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Real Insurance Data Integration**
   - Are the 12 different insurance providers currently connected?  
   - Is the data fetched through an API, or is it still mock data?  
   - If it's API-driven, is there proper error handling for connection issues?  
   - Are there caching mechanisms in place for frequently accessed data?  
   - Is the data displayed accurately and updated in real-time?

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Stripe Payment Integration**
   - Is Stripe already connected to the app?  
   - Are payment forms and checkout processes functioning correctly?  
   - Are there secure payment workflows for one-time payments and subscriptions?  
   - Is there an account management section for users to see their payment history?  
   - Is error handling in place for failed transactions or payment declines?  

üí° **Optional:**  
   - Is there any part of the current implementation that is causing bottlenecks or crashes during testing?  
   - Are we currently storing payment and user data securely with proper encryption?  

I need you to provide a breakdown for each section with:
- The current status of the implementation.
- Any detected issues.
- Suggested improvements if necessary.
- Estimated effort (in hours) to complete each missing or broken part.

Please be as detailed as possible so we can create the next set of prompts to move forward efficiently.
