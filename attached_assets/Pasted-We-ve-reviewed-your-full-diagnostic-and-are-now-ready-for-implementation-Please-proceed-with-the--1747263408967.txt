We’ve reviewed your full diagnostic and are now ready for implementation.

Please proceed with the **complete rebuild of the insurance category system** (Travel, Auto, Pet, Health) and implement all the following global fixes. Read the full list, then reply with a summary of what you understand, and wait for confirmation before proceeding.

---

### 1. Insurance Category Pages – Rebuild From Scratch
Create a new folder `client/src/pages/insurance/` with the following files:
  - `travel.tsx`
  - `auto.tsx`
  - `pet.tsx`
  - `health.tsx`

Each page should:
  - Use the global `MainLayout` component to ensure proper header behavior.
  - Include a category-specific **hero section** with a visually appealing gradient or background.
  - Use updated `PlanCard` components with mock insurance plan data (minimum 3 per category).
  - Display buttons like **Get Quote** and **Compare**, but wired to placeholder routes like `/insurance/travel/quote`.
  - Include scroll-to-top behavior on page mount via `useEffect`.
  - Use Tailwind-based responsive layout (mobile first).
  - Do not include old tab bars or duplicated headers.

---

### 2. Create Consistent `PlanCard` Component
  - Move to `client/src/components/plans/PlanCard.tsx`
  - Accept props like title, provider, price, badge (e.g. "Best Value"), and category.
  - Add compare toggle and `Get Quote` button as props.
  - Match the style of the newer `available-plans` UI (rounded, shadows, hover effects).
  - Use mock data imported into each insurance page (can be from `mockPlans.ts` per category).

---

### 3. Fix Navigation + Transition Flicker
  - Ensure that all category pages reset scroll to top on load.
  - Eliminate any duplicated navbars or layout flash.
  - Investigate and fix double-render or z-index issues in transitions.
  - Consider using a lightweight loading state if delay > 200ms.

---

### 4. Fix Broken Routing for Quote Actions
  - Create placeholder routes for:
    - `/insurance/[category]/quote.tsx`
    - Each should show a mock "quote form" or "under construction" message.
  - Ensure all “Get Quote” and “Compare” buttons across all insurance pages route properly.

---

### 5. Replace Outdated Icons on Home/Menu
  - Travel: use a minimalist airplane icon (solid white or blue)
  - Auto: use a modern car symbol (not outlined)
  - Pet: replace with a clean paw print or silhouette of a pet
  - Health: use a subtle cross or medical bag
  - Store new icons in `/public/assets/insurance-types/` and update import paths

---

### 6. Ensure Global Header Consistency
  - Confirm that all B2C pages (excluding Briki Pilot) use `MainLayout` and global scrollable header
  - Remove all legacy fixed headers from old screens
  - Ensure that mobile nav, auth-enhanced, and plan pages behave consistently

---

### 7. Final Polish
  - Ensure all insurance category pages use consistent padding, spacing, and font sizes
  - Unify font weights and button shapes across new pages
  - Use the new color palette: 
    - Primary: `#003087`
    - Accent: `#0074FF`
    - Glow: `#33BFFF`
