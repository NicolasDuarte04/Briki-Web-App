Please perform a comprehensive audit and fix of the following issues, and ask for any missing code/files you need to complete the task:

⸻

1. Critical Navigation Flow Bug

After login via Pre-Test the App (using auth-screen.tsx), the app incorrectly navigates to /trip-info instead of / or the main home screen.
	•	Expected Behavior: After successful login, redirect the user to the Home screen (usually index.tsx or / route).
	•	Current Behavior: It redirects to /trip-info, which is premature and causes UI issues due to missing context or token propagation.

Please:
	•	Fix the redirect in login.tsx or auth-screen.tsx
	•	Ensure router.replace('/') is used properly after setting auth tokens
	•	Add a brief loading state if necessary to prevent context delay

⸻

2. Overlapping Navbar and Layout Issues

On multiple screens (especially trip-info.tsx), the navbar appears duplicated or overlapping with the page content.

We need to:
	•	Remove all local navbars across every screen (trip-info.tsx, available-plans.tsx, compare-plans.tsx, etc.)
	•	Use a global navigation bar or layout that applies to all screens except the Briki Pilot Portal

Ask:
	•	Which file currently handles the navigation bar globally? (_layout.tsx, Navigation.tsx, etc.)
	•	Does trip-info.tsx or others contain local <Header /> or <Navbar /> components? Please remove them.

⸻

3. Global Layout Consistency

Please confirm and fix the following:
	•	All user-facing screens should inherit a single layout wrapper, with:
	•	Proper safe area
	•	Scrollable content when necessary
	•	Correct paddingTop to avoid overlap with navbar
	•	Only the Briki Pilot Portal screens should use a separate layout

Ask for:
	•	_layout.tsx (or main layout file)
	•	Example screen file such as trip-info.tsx, available-plans.tsx

⸻

4. Visual/UI Bugs on trip-info.tsx

As shown in the shared screenshots:
	•	The dropdowns (country picker, age input, date picker) are either broken or unstyled
	•	The text is not aligned
	•	The spacing is off due to overlapping headers

Please:
	•	Refactor trip-info.tsx to inherit from the fixed layout
	•	Use consistent spacing, padding, and font size
	•	Ensure dropdown and date pickers are functioning

⸻

5. Global UI Micro Fixes (Apply to All Screens)

Apply across all user-facing screens:
	•	Align all content to start below the navbar
	•	Ensure all scrollable content is scroll-enabled, not cut off
	•	Use a single typography and spacing system (16px padding minimum)
	•	Add missing safe area handling and KeyboardAvoidingView where needed

⸻

6. Briki Pilot Portal Exception

Do NOT apply the global layout to the Briki Pilot Portal screens. They may use a separate layout file.

Please confirm:
	•	Which files belong to Briki Pilot?
	•	Likely company-register.tsx, company-login.tsx, briki-pilot-portal.tsx
	•	Leave their layout untouched unless instructed

⸻

What You Need from Me (Please Ask):
	1.	Do you want me to send the current _layout.tsx file?
	2.	Would you like all *.tsx files for user screens? (trip-info, login, register, available-plans, etc.)
	3.	Should I also send auth-context.tsx or router.ts file for debugging redirect logic?

Once you confirm the files needed, I’ll upload them immediately.

Let’s fix this holistically and polish the Briki beta experience.
