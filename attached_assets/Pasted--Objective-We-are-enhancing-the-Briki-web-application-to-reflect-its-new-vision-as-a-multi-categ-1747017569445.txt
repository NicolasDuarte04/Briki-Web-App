# Objective:
We are enhancing the Briki web application to reflect its new vision as a **multi-category insurance platform**, not just focused on travel but covering:
- Travel Insurance
- Auto Insurance
- Pet Insurance
- Health Insurance

This prompt includes updates to navigation, layout, and UI elements to ensure consistency, clarity, and a seamless user experience across all categories.

# Tasks:
## 1️⃣ Navbar Update:
- Update the navbar to reflect the multi-category structure:
  - Home | Travel Insurance | Auto Insurance | Pet Insurance | Health Insurance | Support | Sign In
- Remove redundant or legacy "Travel" mentions.

---

## 2️⃣ Login & Sign Up Page Update:
- Remove the line that says *"Travel Insurance Made Simple"* and replace it with:
  - "All Your Insurance Needs in One Place"
- Update the UI elements to reflect the multi-category structure:
  - If possible, add small icons representing Travel, Auto, Pet, and Health below the text to give a sense of coverage.  

---

## 3️⃣ Remove "Popular Destinations":
- Replace the "Popular Destinations" section with:
  - **Popular Plans:** Highlight top plans across categories.
  - Travel → Top-Rated International Plans
  - Auto → Best Third-Party and Comprehensive Plans
  - Pet → Most Popular Pet Coverage
  - Health → Top-Rated Health Plans
- This new section should be scrollable and allow direct *Get a Quote* or *View Details* interactions.

---

## 4️⃣ Improve Category Cards:
- Currently, the category cards for *Auto*, *Pet*, and *Health* are placeholders.
- Add actual descriptions:
  - Auto Insurance → "Protect your vehicle with reliable coverage options for every need."
  - Pet Insurance → "Give your pets the protection they deserve with medical and accident coverage."
  - Health Insurance → "Find the perfect health plan for your lifestyle and medical needs."

---

## 5️⃣ Smooth Transitions and Animations:
- When switching between categories, the transition should be smooth and visually appealing.
- Implement a slide-in animation or a fade effect to make navigation feel fluid.

---

## 6️⃣ Compare Plans Expansion:
- Ensure the *Compare Plans* logic now handles:
  - Auto Insurance (Liability, Comprehensive, Third-Party)
  - Pet Insurance (Accident, Medical, Routine Care)
  - Health Insurance (Basic, Premium, Global)
- When comparing, display:
  - Price, Coverage Limits, Exclusions, Special Benefits

---

## 7️⃣ CTA Consistency:
- All call-to-action buttons should be consistent:
  - *Get a Quote* → For direct plan exploration
  - *View Details* → For deeper inspection of policy details
  - *Compare Now* → For side-by-side plan analysis

---

## 8️⃣ Footer Update:
- Update the footer to reflect multi-category support:
  - Remove "Travel-focused" text and replace with:
    - "Briki — Your Gateway to Better Insurance: Travel, Auto, Pet, and Health."
  - Add links for each category:
    - Travel Insurance Plans | Auto Insurance Plans | Pet Insurance Plans | Health Insurance Plans

---

## 9️⃣ Mobile Responsiveness:
- Ensure that all new layouts are mobile-friendly:
  - Navbar should collapse into a hamburger menu.
  - Category cards should be swipeable.
  - Comparison view should be scrollable horizontally.

---

# Questions:
1. Should we implement a "Recently Viewed Plans" section for returning users?  
2. Do you want to add a search bar at the top of each category to allow users to filter plans faster?  
3. Should we include animated loaders while switching between categories for a smoother experience?  

---

# Expected Output:
- A fully updated multi-category interface.
- Consistent branding across all categories.
- Smooth navigation and intuitive comparison logic.
- Clear call-to-action and seamless transitions.
