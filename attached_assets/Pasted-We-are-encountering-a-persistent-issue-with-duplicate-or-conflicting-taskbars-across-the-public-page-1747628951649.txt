We are encountering a persistent issue with duplicate or conflicting taskbars across the public pages.

We believe that:
- Multiple taskbar (navigation) components exist in the codebase
- The landing page is using the correct and most modern version
- Other public pages (like /features, /ask-briki, /pricing, etc.) still include legacy or extra nav components
- In some cases, two taskbars are rendering at once — one above the other

Please perform a full audit of the navigation structure with the following questions:

---

### A. Taskbar Component Audit

1. List all components in the codebase that function as **navigation bars** or contain the main site navigation (e.g. taskbar/header links).
   - Include filenames and paths (e.g., `navbar-new.tsx`, `PublicNav.tsx`, etc.)

2. Identify which one is used on the **landing page**
   - Confirm whether it is a standalone component or hardcoded

3. Identify which nav components are used on:
   - `/features`
   - `/ask-briki`
   - `/pricing`
   - `/blog`
   - `/forum`
   - `/careers`

### B. Layout Wrapper Check

4. List all layout wrappers that include a navigation bar:
   - E.g. `PublicLayout.tsx`, `MainLayout.tsx`, `AuthenticatedLayout.tsx`, etc.
   - Show which one is used by each of the pages above

5. Are there **pages that render their own nav bars directly** (not using a shared layout)?  
   - If so, list those pages and components

### C. Action Plan Questions

6. Based on the above, which taskbar is the **correct one** we should use across the entire public experience?

7. What components or pages still use outdated or duplicate nav bars?

8. Can you remove all unused or legacy navigation components from the codebase, and ensure that **only the correct taskbar** (used on the landing page) is rendered on all public routes?

9. Finally, can you confirm the final, single source of truth for the public taskbar component (file name and path)?

Please answer all questions clearly and let us know before making final replacements — we will then review and confirm before you unify the nav system.
