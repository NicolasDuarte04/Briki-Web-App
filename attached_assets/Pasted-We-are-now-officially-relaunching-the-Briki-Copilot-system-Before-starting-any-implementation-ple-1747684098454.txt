We are now officially relaunching the Briki Copilot system.

Before starting any implementation, please read this carefully, and reply with a short summary explaining what you understood. Once you’ve shared your understanding, wait for our confirmation before proceeding. If you need any design references or UI mockups, let us know—we will provide screenshots or visual cues.

### Goal:
We are pivoting Briki Copilot into a professional-grade SaaS platform for insurance companies and brokers. This tool will help them **gain a competitive edge** by analyzing their own insurance plans and comparing them against market trends and other players—whether they are inside or outside of Briki’s marketplace.

### Design Style:
The new Briki Copilot interface should visually align with our **main Briki landing page aesthetic**, but in a **more “Pro” and enterprise-like version**:
- Clean, premium UI
- Blue-teal gradients or soft blues, but more professional and data-focused
- Sharp cards, visual hierarchy, modern typography
- Mobile responsive, light mode only

Let us know if you want visual references and we will send them.

### Functional Features to Plan For:
We are not just redesigning, but redefining the **core functionality** of the Copilot platform. These are the new focus areas:

1. **Data Upload / Sync**
   • Agencies can upload their plan database via CSV, Excel, or API
   • Data includes plan names, features, pricing, demographic focus, exclusions

2. **Competitive Analysis Engine**
   • The platform compares uploaded plans against a Briki-curated dataset or aggregated benchmarks
   • Returns insights such as:
     ◦ “This plan is 25% above market average for dental coverage”
     ◦ “Competitor X includes emergency transport, you don’t”
   • Dashboard-style interface with dynamic charts and alerts

3. **Plan Optimization Dashboard**
   • Suggestions to improve competitiveness
   • Trend tracking over time
   • “Red zones” that highlight inefficiencies or missed opportunities

4. **Optional Public Marketplace Profile**
   • Agencies can choose to be listed on Briki’s public marketplace for consumer visibility
   • This is gated and only enabled if the agency passes certain qualification criteria

5. **UI/UX Expectations**
   • Full-screen layout (not modal-based)
   • Modern charting components (Recharts or similar)
   • Searchable tables with filters
   • Call-to-action buttons for “Upload Plans”, “Compare”, and “Export Report”

### Request:
- Please confirm if you understand the objective of this Copilot pivot
- Summarize your understanding in a paragraph
- Let us know if you need UI inspiration, example images, or dashboard references
- Once confirmed, we will give you the green light to start restructuring and building the new screens and backend logic

This is a critical part of Briki’s B2B value proposition, and we want to get it right. Looking forward to your response.
