We’d like to fully redesign and rebuild the authentication screen (login + signup) from scratch. The current implementation is not working as intended and lacks cohesion between the UI, server logic, and navigation flow. Please help us with the following:

**GOAL:**  
Create a robust and modern authentication flow with Google OAuth that:
- Uses correct client-side and server-side logic
- Has proper routing and error handling
- Matches the Briki design language and provides a seamless login/signup experience
- Ensures persistent auth across sessions and pages

---

**Questions we need answered before starting:**

1. **Technical Stack Alignment**
   • Which files are currently managing the auth logic on both client and server?
   • Do we have a centralized auth provider (e.g. `useAuth` or similar context)?
   • Can we fully deprecate the existing modal-based or fragmented auth flows?

2. **Routing Behavior**
   • What’s the current behavior after a successful login or signup?
   • Is there logic in place to redirect users based on previous route or default to `/`?
   • What routes are currently protected via `ProtectedRoute` or equivalent?

3. **Google OAuth Setup**
   • Is the callback properly saving session data in cookies/localStorage?
   • What middleware or passport strategy are we currently using?
   • Does the server route `/api/auth/google/callback` finish the session and issue a usable JWT or session?

4. **UI Implementation**
   • Can you rebuild the UI as per the Figma or screenshot sent above?
   • We want a single page with toggle tabs for Login and Signup (not two separate pages)
   • Google login should be the primary button, with secondary options for email/password (if supported later)

5. **Persistent Session**
   • Does the session persist across page refreshes and route changes?
   • If not, what’s missing in the current setup?

6. **Error Handling**
   • Is there currently any toast/snackbar feedback for auth failures or redirects?
   • Can we standardize auth error handling in one place?

**Final Notes:**
Please provide:
- A complete list of files that will be affected or replaced
- Suggested file structure for the new auth flow
- Any third-party libraries you recommend for a more scalable auth approach (e.g. next-auth alternatives if applicable)

We want this to be a production-grade feature we can license and rely on. Let’s make it clean, modular, and UI-consistent.
