### Briki Background Polish – Animated Gradient & Visual Identity Refinement

Hi! Now that the light mode UI is implemented, the background feels clean but a bit too bland. We want to give it **visual richness and branded personality**, without returning to the dark theme.

Please update the **background on both the Countdown screen and the Auth/Login screen** with the following approach:

---

### 1. Animated Gradient Background (Soft Futuristic AI Style)

**Visual Style Goals:**
- Brighter, modern, and energetic (like Stripe or Apple’s AI demos)
- Soft animation to add life and motion
- High readability for interface elements (buttons, forms, etc.)

**Target Color Gradient:**
```css
background: radial-gradient(
  circle at 30% 30%,
  #D0F1FF,
  #B0DBFF,
  #A8C7FF,
  #BFC8F8,
  #F0F4FF
);
```

**Tailwind version:**
```js
from-[#D0F1FF] via-[#B0DBFF] to-[#F0F4FF]
```

### 2. Subtle Animated Effects (Optional but Recommended)

If feasible, apply one of the following subtle background animations:

- **Slow animated gradient shift** (CSS keyframe loop or animated background position)
- **Floating glowing particles** (faded pulse or AI-like dots)
- **Pulsing radial glow** around center/focus areas
- Ensure **mobile-friendly performance**

These effects should feel elegant and premium — not distracting.

### 3. Where to Apply

Please apply the new background to:

- `/` (Countdown Screen)
- `/auth` (Login/Register Screen)
- Optionally, also to the main Home page or Plan Selector for visual consistency

### 4. Visual Reference

We want something inspired by **Stripe's elegant gradients** or **Apple’s Editor’s Choice app animations**. Here’s a sample reference:

### 5. Final Notes

Let us know if you need fallback versions for low-end devices, or if you want branded SVG overlays (e.g., subtle floating icons or logos). We're aiming for a UI that feels **playful yet premium**, soft yet futuristic.

Let us know when you're ready to implement!
