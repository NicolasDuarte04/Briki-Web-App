Hey, I’d like to conduct a full diagnosis of the current authentication implementation. We’re experiencing both UI inconsistencies and functional failures across login and registration.

Please go through the checklist below to help us identify and resolve all issues:

⸻

1. UI Consistency Checks
	•	Why is the Login and Sign Up card box not visually consistent in size and alignment?
	•	Please check if different padding/margin or width values are being used across these two components.
	•	Are they using the same shared component base or different layout containers?
	•	Make sure spacing, font weight, and vertical alignment match between both forms.

2. Auth Flow Debugging

We are still seeing:
	•	“Registration failed” even when using valid, fabricated email addresses.
	•	Login fails even for accounts that were just created via Google login.

Please verify and answer:
	•	Is the database properly connected and accepting write/read operations from the frontend?
	•	Can you confirm whether users created via Google login are being inserted properly into the users table?
	•	Are registration attempts failing silently because of an insert issue or model conflict?
	•	Are backend try/catch blocks masking the real error? Can we log the raw error to console or store it?

3. Registration Form Validation
	•	Can you confirm that email + password + confirm password are now the only required fields?
	•	Is confirmPassword properly validated both client- and server-side?
	•	Are all constraints for email uniqueness, password strength, and agreement to ToS being checked correctly?

4. Backend Schema Alignment
	•	Is the current schema treating username as optional in both Drizzle ORM and the database layer?
	•	Is the createUser() function now using the Drizzle .insert() method, or is any raw SQL/legacy logic still active?

5. Visual Enhancements Needed
	•	Can we add subtle shadow/elevation to the form card?
	•	Can we add green success indicators or checkmarks next to validated fields?
	•	Can we unify the button heights, spacing, and hover styles across Login and Sign Up?

6. Deployment Validation
	•	Is the behavior consistent across:
	•	https://brikiapp.com
	•	localhost:5000
	•	*.replit.dev staging links?
	•	Do we have any environment variable mismatches or deployment caching issues?

Goal

We want a stable, clean, and visually aligned login/signup experience that works flawlessly across environments and device sizes. Please diagnose and fix all the above, and confirm once each is complete so we can retest it live.

Thanks!
