We are moving forward with the creation of a **New Countdown Screen** for the Briki Web Application. I need you to complete the following tasks:

---

### üåü **1Ô∏è‚É£ New Countdown Screen**  
**Objective:** Display the time left until the official launch of Briki.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Create a **completely new screen** (do not update the existing screen) with the following elements:  
   - **Countdown Timer** in the format: **Days : Hours : Minutes : Seconds**  
   - Smooth animations for counting down.  
   - Modern and futuristic design to match Briki's aesthetic.  

2. Style it to match Briki's futuristic design with:  
   - Clean typography.  
   - Animated transitions for each time unit change.  
   - Dark mode and light mode compatibility.  

3. When the timer reaches **00:00:00:00**, display a message:  
   - "Briki is now live! Welcome to the Future of Insurance."

### üåü **2Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Test the App Button**  
**Objective:** Allow users to explore the app before the official launch.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Add a button directly below the countdown timer labeled **"Pre-Test the App"**.  
2. When clicked, it should navigate users to the **existing Login and Register screens**.  
   - These should be the current login and register screens you have already built.  
   - No new screens should be created‚Äîjust link to the existing ones.  

3. Display a **disclaimer banner** at the top of the login and register screens saying:  
   - "You are exploring the Beta version of Briki. Some features may be under development. Payments are currently disabled during this phase."  

4. Add an **info icon** next to the disclaimer that, when clicked, explains:  
   - "This version of Briki is for testing purposes only. Payments are disabled, and some features may not function as intended. Full functionality will be available upon official launch."  

5. **Disable all payment functionalities** during the Beta phase to avoid accidental charges.

### üåü **3Ô∏è‚É£ UI Enhancements**  
**Objective:** Improve visual engagement for early users.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Add a futuristic background to the new Countdown Screen.  
2. Implement smooth hover animations on the "Pre-Test the App" button.  
3. Ensure full mobile responsiveness for the new screen.  

---

### **Expected Deliverables:**  
- A **new standalone Countdown Screen** with a fully functional timer.  
- "Pre-Test the App" button that navigates to the **existing Login and Register screens**.  
- Clear disclaimer banner and info icon to set user expectations.  
- Payment features disabled during the Beta phase.  
- Responsive design and smooth UI transitions.  

Please provide a detailed report of:  
- Screenshots of the new Countdown Screen.  
- Confirmation that the "Pre-Test the App" button links to the current Login and Register screens.  
- Any issues or blockers encountered during implementation.  

If there are any challenges, provide a detailed explanation so we can resolve them quickly.
