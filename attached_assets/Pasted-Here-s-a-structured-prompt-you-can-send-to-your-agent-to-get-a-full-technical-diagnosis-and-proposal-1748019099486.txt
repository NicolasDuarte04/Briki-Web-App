Here’s a structured prompt you can send to your agent to get a full technical diagnosis and proposal without triggering any changes yet:

Prompt to Agent:

Hi, I need your help reviewing an important UX change we’re considering. Please read carefully and provide a diagnosis of the current architecture, answer the following questions, and propose a clean strategy for implementation — but do not make any changes yet until we give the go-ahead.

⸻

Context:

We want to allow new users to experience the app without requiring authentication first. Specifically:
	•	When a user clicks “Pre-Test the App” on the landing page, they should go directly to a public quote flow or assistant interaction (e.g. /dashboard, /get-quote, or /trip-info) without logging in.
	•	Login should only be required when the user takes a critical action like saving a plan, buying a policy, or viewing quote history.
	•	The experience should feel fun, low-friction, and guided by curiosity — not gated by login walls.

⸻

Questions to Answer:
	1.	Current Structure
	•	Which routes in the app currently require authentication?
	•	Is the /trip-info, /dashboard, or /get-quote route protected by default?
	•	Is the AI Assistant currently public or behind login?
	2.	Quote Flow Accessibility
	•	What’s the technical logic currently triggering redirects to /auth?
	•	Is there a wrapper or hook (e.g. useAuthRedirect) responsible for forcing authentication?
	3.	Session Management
	•	How are we currently managing session state for logged-in users?
	•	Is it possible to track anonymous activity (e.g. sessionStorage or localStorage) until the user logs in?
	4.	What’s Working
	•	What parts of the current flow already support unauthenticated users?
	•	Can users reach any interactive flow without logging in today?
	5.	What Needs to Change
	•	Which components or routes would need to be unguarded?
	•	Where should conditional login prompts be implemented (e.g. “Log in to buy this plan”)?
	6.	Your Proposal
	•	How would you implement this public-first flow while preserving security and personalization?
	•	Would you use feature flags, conditional redirects, or public route guards?
	•	Are there any risks or caveats we should know before proceeding?

Again, please don’t edit anything yet. Just give us a comprehensive diagnosis + proposal so we can make a final call.

Thanks!
