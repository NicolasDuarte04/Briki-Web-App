We are ready to apply a design refinement to the Briki Web Application that shifts our current dark-dominant UI to a lighter, more friendly, AI-inspired aesthetic.

This change is **not a full redesign**â€”the current layout, structure, and animations are excellent and should be preserved. The goal is to update the **color language and visual tone** across the platform to align with a more welcoming and soft AI experience, inspired by the reference image weâ€™ve uploaded (light purples, pinks, and whites with a clean gradient glow).

### ðŸŒŸ Scope of the Task:

1. **Update the Visual Theme to a Lighter, Soothing AI Style**

**Goal:** Transition away from the current dark theme to a clean, calm, and professional aesthetic.

**Tasks:**
- Replace dark backgrounds with a **white-dominant base** enriched by **soft purple and pink gradients**.
- Reference the image provided (light pastel tones, subtle glow) as the **visual tone**.
- Maintain **fluid animations** already implemented â€” only the visual color tones should change.
- Adjust input fields, buttons, and hover states to match the new lighter palette.
- Avoid harsh contrasts or dark overlays â€” everything should feel soft, readable, and modern.

2. **Apply Design Update to All Category Screens**

**Goal:** Make sure that the following pages reflect the **same modern UI styling** already present in the home screen and main sections.

**Tasks:**
- Travel Insurance Page
- Auto Insurance Page
- Pet Insurance Page
- Health Insurance Page

Each of these should:
- Use the updated light theme with the same elegance and animations
- Be aligned with the home screenâ€™s layout and motion
- Ensure all interactive elements feel cohesive with the rest of the app

3. **Icon Refinement (as previously discussed)**

**Goal:** Keep the current animated icons but tone them down slightly to match the new theme.

**Tasks:**
- Maintain existing animations (no need to redesign)
- Adjust their color tones to match the new UI: subtle gradients, polished, no excessive glow
- Ensure icons are responsive and properly positioned

### ðŸ’¡ Technical Reminders:

- Do not break any navigation or authentication logic
- Ensure responsiveness for desktop and mobile views
- Use existing components where possibleâ€”this is a **visual and tonal update**, not a structural overhaul
- Global elements like the **Navbar** and **Floating Assistant Button** should also reflect the new visual theme

---

### ðŸ“¦ Deliverables:

- Updated light theme applied globally
- Fully styled category pages (Travel, Auto, Pet, Health)
- All buttons, cards, and forms updated to the new aesthetic
- Icons polished and visually aligned with the new tone
- No loss of functionality or UX
