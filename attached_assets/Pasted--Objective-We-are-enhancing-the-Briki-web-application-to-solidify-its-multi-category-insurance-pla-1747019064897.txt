# Questions:
1. For the *horizontal scroll implementation*, are you planning to use **React Slick**, **SwiperJS**, or a custom solution?
2. When creating the **custom loader animation**, would you like me to provide a design, or will you create one with CSS or a lightweight animation library?
3. For the **Recently Viewed Plans** section, do you want a limit on the number of items displayed? (e.g., last 5 plans only)
4. Are you planning to use **React Context** or **Redux** for state management of the "Recently Viewed Plans"?
