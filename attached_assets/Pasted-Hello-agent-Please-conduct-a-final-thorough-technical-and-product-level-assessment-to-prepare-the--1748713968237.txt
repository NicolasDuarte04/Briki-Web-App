Hello agent. Please conduct a final, thorough technical and product-level assessment to prepare the Briki app for public release.

We want you to **evaluate the entire app** from the perspective of being its full-time product manager and lead developer. Your task is to **systematically answer the following questions** across all relevant files and functionality:

üß† PRODUCT READINESS
1. Are all core features stable and intuitive (landing ‚Üí assistant ‚Üí plan recommendation ‚Üí selection)?
2. Do we have working fallback flows for edge cases (e.g. no plan found, AI returns null, user skips questions)?
3. Are the AI recommendations clearly structured in the code and traceable?
4. Is mobile responsiveness fully implemented across views and components?

üîê SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
5. Are we correctly handling user data across the stack (frontend, API, database)?
6. Are there any missing compliance elements (GDPR, Latin American privacy laws)?
7. Are external APIs (e.g. plan providers) being called securely and within proper authorization limits?

üß™ PERFORMANCE & QA
8. Have we identified and resolved any high-load or API fail scenarios?
9. Are logs, errors, and backend failures being recorded in a trackable way?
10. Have we tested the full app across modern browsers and devices?

üéØ USER EXPERIENCE & TRUST
11. Is the onboarding process clear and frictionless?
12. Do the AI recommendations feel trustworthy (structure, disclaimers, tone)?
13. Is there any social proof or testimonial mechanism in place?
14. Is our brand tone consistent across the interface and AI messages?

üìä ANALYTICS & GROWTH
15. Are analytics tracking core events like AI queries, plan card views, CTA clicks, and funnel drops?
16. Is Google Analytics (or another tool) installed and operational in production?
17. Do we have any feedback collection method integrated (e.g. "was this helpful?" or NPS)?

üõ†Ô∏è SCALABILITY & MAINTAINABILITY
18. Is the architecture prepared for scaling to more insurance categories?
19. Can we add new categories, plans, or questions without breaking logic?
20. Do we have enough documentation or modularity to onboard future devs or partners?

üì¶ POST-LAUNCH & SUPPORT
21. Is there a support mechanism (chat, form, email, etc.) available for users?
22. Are error handling and fast hotfix pathways ready in case something breaks post-launch?
23. Are there any hardcoded routes, legacy components, or non-production assets left?

Please investigate each question with supporting file references and detailed diagnostics. The goal is to get a complete launch-readiness score across all technical and product dimensions.
