  - Display:
    - Last viewed time (e.g., "5 minutes ago")

    - **3D rotate-Y transformation** of the Briki text logo
    - **Horizontal progress bar animation** that fills during loading
  - Avoid white screens during transition.
  - Ensure the loader is consistent across mobile and desktop.
  - The loader is optimized with **CSS animations and SVG** for performance.

# Questions:
1. For the "Best Value" badge logic, are you evaluating the cost/coverage ratio dynamically in real-time?
2. In the global search bar, can users switch categories directly from search results (e.g., type "pet:" and be taken to Pet Insurance)?
3. Are the "Recently Viewed Plans" auto-synced with local storage when changes happen, or only on session refresh?
4. For the loader, are you planning to optimize it with **requestAnimationFrame** for smoother transitions?

---

# Expected Output:
- Complete, mobile-responsive, multi-category experience.
- Smooth navigation and category transitions.
- Interactive, swipeable elements for a better user experience.
- Briki branding fully aligned with the new multi-category vision.
