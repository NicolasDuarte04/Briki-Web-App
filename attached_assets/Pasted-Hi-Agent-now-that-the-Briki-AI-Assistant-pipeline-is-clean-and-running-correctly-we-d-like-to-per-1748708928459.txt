Hi Agent — now that the Briki AI Assistant pipeline is clean and running correctly, we’d like to perform a **full technical diagnosis of the Briki app** to ensure stability, efficiency, and readiness for production across all major areas.

Please perform a full-scope diagnostic and answer the following questions with clear ✅/❌ status and detailed explanations where necessary:

---

🧱 **Frontend Health Check**
1. Are there any unused or duplicate UI components still present in `client/src/components`?
2. Are all public pages (e.g., /features, /pricing, /blog, /forum, /careers) wrapped in the correct layout (`<PublicLayout />`) and NOT rendering dashboard-style UI?
3. Are there any inconsistent or outdated layout implementations (`AuthenticatedLayout`, `PublicLayout`, `CompanyLayout`) across pages?
4. Are there any unnecessary route definitions or broken links in `App.tsx`?
5. Is the global `<Navbar />` and `<Footer />` usage standardized and non-redundant across all layouts?

---

🧠 **AI & Assistant System Check**
6. Are assistant queries routed *only* through the new `/ask-briki-ai` flow?
7. Is `NewBrikiAssistant.tsx` the only active assistant interface?
8. Does the OpenAI backend service respond with valid structure (message + suggestedPlans) for *all* categories (pet, auto, travel, health)?
9. Are follow-up questions triggering proper memory and plan redisplay?
10. Are all plan rendering issues (in `SuggestedPlans.tsx` and `PlanCard.tsx`) resolved?

---

🔧 **Backend/API Health**
11. Are there any deprecated or unused service files in `/server/services/`?
12. Are all active API routes correctly documented and protected if necessary?
13. Is the `/api/blog/rss` feed functioning at `https://brikiapp.com/api/blog/rss` with correct content format?
14. Is the blog CMS/database syncing correctly with the RSS feed and rendering on `/blog`?
15. Are there any backend logs showing recurring warnings or unhandled errors?

---

📈 **Performance & Optimization**
16. Are there large unused JS/CSS bundles affecting load time?
17. Are animations and transitions optimized for mobile?
18. Is lazy-loading or code-splitting implemented on key components/pages?
19. Are there unnecessary API calls or duplicated queries triggered during assistant use?
20. Are caching and retry strategies set up for backend requests?

---

🧪 **Deployment & Readiness**
21. Are all build scripts working cleanly with no warnings?
22. Is the latest deployment version pointing to `https://brikiapp.com` correctly?
23. Are all console errors (both frontend and backend) resolved in current deployment?
24. Is there any test/demo content or logic still present in production files?
25. Are we ready for live user onboarding from a technical perspective?

Let us know if you’d like a CSV template or checklist format for future diagnostics. Please begin the full validation and send back your findings when ready.
