Please begin the full implementation of the new Briki Landing Page using the specifications below. Do **not** start until you confirm you understand each instruction. Once confirmed, proceed step-by-step with modular commits (e.g., HeroSection.tsx, CountdownCard.tsx, etc.).

Overview:
This is a complete redesign of the `/` route (currently `CountdownPage`). You will **replace** it with a professional dual-audience landing page inspired by [Cursor.com](https://cursor.com), styled in line with Briki’s new design system.

This page must clearly divide between:
- **Consumer (B2C)**: public users exploring Briki to compare and purchase insurance
- **Partner (B2B)**: insurance companies learning about Briki’s distribution and analytics tools

---

### FILE: `landing-page.tsx` (new or overwrite `countdown-page.tsx`)

---

## 1. Page Sections (Vertical Flow)

**A. NavBar**
- Reuse existing shared `<Navbar />` component
- Add anchor links (scroll-to) for `#for-users`, `#for-partners`, `#contact`

**B. Hero Section (B2C)** — `id="for-users"`
- Large animated headline: “Smarter Insurance Starts Here”
- Subtitle: “Compare, choose, and understand insurance in seconds.”
- CTA Button: “Pre-Test the App” → `/auth`
- Subtext: “Beta access now open.”
- Background: light blue-to-white gradient (like Cursor), animated glow blobs

**C. Countdown Card**
- Positioned **below** Hero Section
- Uses navy + glow color palette (`#003087`, `#33BFFF`)
- Persistent with `localStorage` (React hooks)
- Auto-hides when expired (flag-based)
- Feature flag: `SHOW_COUNTDOWN = true` (use config)

**D. “Why Briki” Feature Grid**
- Grid of 3–4 feature cards (icons + text)
  - “AI-Powered Recommendations”
  - “Compare Across Providers”
  - “One-Click Checkout”
  - “Real-Time Policy Tracking”
- Animate cards on scroll using Framer Motion

**E. Partner CTA Section (B2B)** — `id="for-partners"`
- Background switches to **navy** (`#003087`)
- Headline: “For Insurance Providers”
- Subtext: “Briki helps you distribute, measure, and optimize your plans.”
- CTA Buttons: 
  - “Register as a Partner” → `/company-register`
  - “Explore Dashboard” → `/briki-pilot`
- Include subtle logos or metrics (e.g. “+12k comparisons daily”)
- Match Briki Pilot UI tone

**F. Footer**
- Reuse existing shared `<Footer />`
- Add navigation links: About, Terms, Contact

---

## 2. Visual Design Guidelines

- **Color Palette**
  - Primary: `#003087` (navy)
  - Accent: `#0074FF`
  - Glow: `#33BFFF`
  - Remove all purple, indigo, fuchsia tints

- **Typography**
  - Font scale must be consistent across B2C/B2B
  - Hero headings: `text-5xl md:text-6xl font-extrabold`
  - Section headers: `text-3xl font-bold`
  - Body: `text-base md:text-lg`

- **Animation**
  - Use `Framer Motion` for all entrances
  - Use same animation constants across sections
  - Countdown should animate to success state post-expiry

- **Responsiveness**
  - All layouts must collapse into vertical flow for mobile
  - Padding: `px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8` across all sections
  - CTA buttons must be large and accessible on touch devices

---

## 3. SEO and Meta

- Add meta tags (title, description) in `<Helmet>` or head
- Include OpenGraph and Twitter tags
- Add structured data (`application/ld+json`) for Briki App
- Ensure all images and icons have `alt` text

---

## 4. Countdown Success State

- On countdown expiry:
  - Replace timer with: “Briki is now live!”
  - Add modal with:
    - “Get Started” → `/auth`
    - “Learn More” → `/explore`
  - Animate background card to success color (`bg-green-600/10`)
  - Remove or fade out countdown logic if expired

---

## 5. Component Breakdown (Optional File Splits)

If breaking this into files, follow:

- `landing-page.tsx` (main export)
- `Hero.tsx`
- `CountdownCard.tsx`
- `FeatureGrid.tsx`
- `PartnerCTA.tsx`
- `ModalAfterLaunch.tsx`
- `config.ts` → holds `SHOW_COUNTDOWN = true`

---

## Final Notes

- This page **replaces** the current `/` route and becomes the first thing users see on BrikiApp.com
- It must look polished, production-ready, and suitable for **investor demos**
- Maintain loading performance and animation fluidity
- Confirm design with `briki-pilot-portal.tsx` for consistent feel

Please confirm this plan and begin implementing `landing-page.tsx`. Once Hero, Countdown, and Partner CTA are ready, pause and request confirmation before continuing to the rest.
