We’re now ready to rebuild the entire main screen of the Briki app. Please read the following instructions carefully and treat this as a new, clean implementation of the post-login interface:

1. **Navigation Bar (Top Taskbar)**
   - Use the exact same top bar style and layout that appears in the Briki landing page.
   - This includes the typography, spacing, colors, and the Briki logo version (the one that appears on the landing page, not the alternate login version).
   - Ensure the logo doesn’t change as users navigate across the app — it must remain consistent.

2. **Main Dashboard UI (After Login)**
   - Use the same font, gradients, spacing, and general aesthetic used in the landing page design.
   - Make sure the home screen feels modern, clean, and intuitive — not overloaded with elements.
   - The layout should feel like a natural extension of the landing page, not a separate design system.

3. **Functional Elements Required**
   - A welcome message at the top (personalized if possible: “Welcome back, [firstName]”).
   - Quick access cards or links to:
     - Compare Insurance Plans
     - Get a Quote
     - Track My Quotes
     - Saved Plans / Favorites
   - Show one featured recommendation (optional, placeholder now).
   - Include a footer similar in style to the landing page.

4. **Technical and Cleanup Notes**
   - Before building, confirm and remove unused or legacy UI components and routes.
   - Confirm that the new dashboard will be located at `/home` for authenticated users.
   - Ensure the layout uses `AuthenticatedLayout.tsx` for proper route guarding and navigation.
   - Confirm there are no conflicting styles, duplicated headers, or mixed layout providers.

5. **Consistency**
   - Double-check that the entire app (landing, login, main menu, comparison, quote flow) uses the same Briki branding elements (logo version, font, colors).
   - Pay attention to mobile responsiveness — no overlapping or broken layouts.

Once you confirm these design parameters, proceed to rebuild the main dashboard. Let us know if you need new design assets or visual references — otherwise, you can use the current landing page as your design source.
