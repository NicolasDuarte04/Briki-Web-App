You are rebuilding the `countdown-page.tsx` in the Briki web app.

Goal:
Create a visually stunning, clean, Apple-level launch countdown page for Briki’s global release on June 1, 2025. The design must feel modern, futuristic, and minimal, using glassmorphism and soft gradients.

---

A. Overall Design
- Use a soft animated background with blurred gradient blobs (like in the original countdown-page.tsx)
- Keep layout minimal and centered with ample white space
- Use `AnimatedBackground` as fallback if needed
- Avoid clutter. Focus on clarity, smooth animations, and hierarchy

---

B. Hero Section
- Briki logo as heading:
  `text-6xl md:text-7xl font-extrabold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-600 to-blue-500 drop-shadow-sm`
- Subtitle:
  `Global Launch Countdown – June 1, 2025`

---

C. Countdown Timer
- Use a 4-column grid: Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds
- Each time unit in a `GlassCard` (variant="primary") with hover glow and motion animations
- Inside the card: `motion.span` with animated scaling and `text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-600 to-blue-500`
- Below each card: unit label in lowercase: `text-sm font-medium capitalize text-foreground/70`

---

D. Value Proposition Section
- Wrap in a `GlassCard` centered on the page
- Header:
  `"The easiest way to compare and understand insurance plans"`
- Subtext:
  `"Powered by AI to deliver personalized insurance recommendations tailored to your unique needs."`

- Below this, a grid of 2x2 features (reuse the `features` array from countdown-page-new):
  - Personalized Insurance (StarIcon)
  - Secure Platform (LockIcon)
  - Real-Time Alerts (BellIcon)
  - Trusted Partners (ShieldCheckIcon)
- Each feature has:
  - Icon in `text-indigo-500`
  - Title: `font-medium text-foreground`
  - Description: `text-sm text-foreground/70`

---

E. Call to Action
- Use `GradientButton` (size="lg") with text `Pre-Test the App`
- Icon: ArrowRightIcon (Lucide)
- On click, navigate to `/auth`
- Below the button: `text-sm text-foreground/60` — `Early access for our community members`

---

F. Beta Disclaimer (NO `BetaNotice` component)
- Create a subtle `GlassCard` (variant="blue", size="sm") at the bottom
- Title: ShieldCheckIcon + `Beta Notice`
- Text:
  `"You are accessing a beta version of Briki. Payments are currently disabled for testing purposes."`

---

G. Design Tokens / Tailwind Rules
- Use `hsl(var(--token))` for colors via Tailwind config:
  - Examples: `text-foreground`, `bg-card/50`, `border-border`, `text-primary`, `bg-muted`, etc.
- Avoid hardcoded colors unless for animated gradient blobs
- Use `motion.div` and `motion.span` for smooth entrance transitions (`scale`, `fade`, `slide`, `pulse`)
- Maintain accessibility: semantic tags and screen-reader support

---

End Result:
This screen should feel futuristic, soft, trustworthy, and elegant. It should convey a sense of polish and readiness for launch, aligned with Briki’s visual style and product tone.
