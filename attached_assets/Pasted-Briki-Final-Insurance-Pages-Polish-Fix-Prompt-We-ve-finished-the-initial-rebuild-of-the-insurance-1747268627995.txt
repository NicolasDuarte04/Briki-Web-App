Briki Final Insurance Pages Polish – Fix Prompt

We’ve finished the initial rebuild of the insurance category pages, but there are still multiple visual and layout issues that must be resolved before public rollout.

Please fix the following across `/insurance/*` pages (Travel, Auto, Pet, Health):

---

1. ✅ **Fix Double Navbar Conflict**
• Several insurance pages currently show **two navigation bars** due to double MainLayout usage.
• ✅ Action:
  – Remove the individual `<MainLayout>` wrappers inside page files like `pet.tsx`, `travel.tsx`, etc.
  – Keep the one declared globally in `App.tsx` (lines ~149–155).
  – Confirm that only one header/nav appears per page.

---

2. ✅ **Fix Hero Image Obstruction**
• The hero image background is being **partially hidden** by the white content below.
• Cause: bad `z-index`, overlapping margin, or insufficient padding between sections.
• ✅ Action:
  – Add proper `z-index` layering to bring hero image and title to the front.
  – Adjust margin/padding to ensure the “Why Choose Briki” section doesn’t overlap hero.
  – Ensure background hero images are **fully visible** across all insurance category pages.

---

3. ✅ **Unify Page Layout & Padding**
• Pages currently have inconsistent top spacing, margin, and safe-area handling.
• ✅ Action:
  – Create a shared layout wrapper (like `<ContentWrapper>` or `<SafeArea>`).
  – Ensure every `/insurance/*` page:
    • Starts **below the navbar**
    • Has consistent `paddingX` and `paddingTop`
    • Scrolls properly and doesn’t clip content on mobile

---

4. ✅ **Fix Scroll Behavior & Navigation Flicker**
• Navigation between insurance pages results in a **brief flicker** and inconsistent scroll.
• ✅ Action:
  – Add `useEffect(() => window.scrollTo(0, 0))` on mount in each insurance page.
  – Remove conflicting animation libraries (e.g., Framer Motion vs CSS transitions).
  – Ensure no page loads show visual glitches on entry.

---

5. ✅ **(Optional but Recommended) Convert Hero to Shared Component**
• All insurance pages use slightly different hero sections.
• ✅ Action:
  – If efficient, extract a shared `<HeroSection />` component into `components/insurance/`
  – Otherwise, unify each page’s hero section to have **identical structure and style**

---

6. ✅ **Final Consistency Pass**
• Confirm:
  – All pages load cleanly, scroll from the top
  – No double headers
  – Hero images visible and responsive
  – Clean spacing between sections
  – No visual jump/glitch during transitions

---

Once done, please send:
1. Screenshots of each insurance page after fixes
2. A short summary of what was implemented
3. Confirmation that all layout issues are now resolved

You may now begin. Let us know if any additional file structure or layout logic blocks you.

Thank you!
