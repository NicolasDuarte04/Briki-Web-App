Briki App Final Validation Questions – Are We Achieving the Goal?

I. Navigation & UX
	1.	Are all navbar links now conditionally routed based on authentication status?
	•	Example: Do authenticated users see /insurance/* links while public users see /explore/*?
	2.	Is navigation smooth and scroll-safe across all screens?
	•	Do all pages scroll to top on navigation?
	•	Is there any flicker or content jump?
	3.	Do we still experience any layout shift or double navbar issues?
	4.	Can you confirm that MainLayout is used only for authenticated routes, and ExploreLayout is used exclusively on public routes?

II. Explore Page Validation
	5.	Are the new /explore/* pages fully independent?
	•	Do they have no dependency on app state, login context, or backend features?
	6.	Are all hero sections rendering properly across all /explore/* pages?
	•	Any remaining z-index or image obstruction issues?
	7.	Are CTA buttons in /explore/* routes always routing to /auth (login/signup)?
	8.	Are the SEO meta tags rendering correctly inside the <head> of each explore page?
	•	Do you recommend using react-helmet or another method for OpenGraph, title, and description?

III. Authenticated App Pages
	9.	Are all /insurance/* routes still fully functional with:
	•	Plan comparison
	•	Quote flow
	•	Mock data rendering
	10.	Do authenticated users entering / get routed to the correct post-login homepage?
	11.	Are there any paths where authenticated users might unintentionally land on /explore/* instead of /insurance/*?

⸻

IV. Routing Conflicts
	12.	Do legacy routes like /auto-insurance, /travel-insurance, etc., still exist?

	•	If so, are they properly redirected to /explore/*?

	13.	Are there any route priority conflicts where older routes override intended ones?
	14.	Do dynamic routes (e.g. /insurance/[category]/quote.tsx) still work as expected?

⸻

V. Visual & Component Consistency
	15.	Are the icons used in all Explore pages now finalized, consistent, and matching Briki’s minimalist style?
	16.	Are all buttons styled properly now?

	•	Was the variant="primary" error resolved in navbar-new.tsx or in the button component itself?

	17.	Is there any duplicate content or code bloat between /explore/* and /insurance/* that should be refactored?

⸻

VI. Technical Hygiene
	18.	Is the current client/src/ directory clean and logically organized?

	•	Any unused pages, duplicated components, or legacy files we can delete?

	19.	Are the layouts (MainLayout, ExploreLayout) clearly separated and working without side effects?
	20.	Are there any bugs, warnings, or console errors currently in the Replit preview or build logs?

⸻

VII. Bonus – Recommended Improvements
	21.	Is there any technical debt we should clean before launch?
	22.	Do you recommend unifying any components (like a global Hero.tsx, or shared content models) to reduce duplication?
	23.	Would you suggest implementing auth-aware navigation as a reusable hook or higher-order component?

Once we get clear answers to these, we’ll know with certainty:
	•	if the public/SEO layer (/explore/*) works perfectly for new visitors,
	•	if the authenticated product layer (/insurance/*) is functionally strong and bug-free, and
	•	if the navigation and layout systems are now modular, scalable, and cleanly separated.
