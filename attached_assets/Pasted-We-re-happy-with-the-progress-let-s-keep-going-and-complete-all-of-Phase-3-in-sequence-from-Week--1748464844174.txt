We’re happy with the progress — let’s keep going and complete all of Phase 3 in sequence, from Week 1 through Week 3, without pauses unless issues arise. Below is the detailed breakdown of what we expect in each week:

⸻

📦 Week 1 – Performance & Core UX (Scalability & Speed)
	1.	✅ Pagination System (already completed)
	•	Modular pagination component (20 plans per page by default)
	•	Integrated into the travel insurance page
	•	Analytics tracking for user interaction
	2.	🛠 Advanced Filtering System
	•	Sliders for coverage amount, deductible range
	•	Multi-select checkboxes for providers, features, categories
	•	Tag-based filtering logic (e.g., “COVID coverage”, “international accepted”)
	•	UX: Active filter indicators, “clear all” button
	•	Frontend-only filtering for now — backend integration in later phase
	3.	🚀 Lazy Loading & Virtualization
	•	Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for large components
	•	Lazy load plan detail modals and large sections
	•	Virtualized list rendering for long plan lists

⸻

💡 Week 2 – Smart Features (Intelligence & Engagement)
	4.	📊 Dynamic Plan Insights
	•	“Best Value” badge based on coverage-to-price ratio
	•	“Most Popular” based on selection frequency or view count
	•	Show plan-level analytics if possible
	5.	🔍 Enhanced Search
	•	Implement smart search matching across plan names, providers, and tags
	•	Typing “AXA + COVID + USA” returns relevant filtered results
	•	Debounced search bar and results count
	6.	🧾 Quote Flow Improvements
	•	Form fields that adapt based on selected plan features
	•	Real-time estimated price preview
	•	Store selected filters during quote flow navigation

🧼 Week 3 – UI Polish & Optimization (Production Readiness)
	7.	🎨 UI/UX Consistency Fixes
	•	Review all layouts for visual hierarchy and spacing
	•	Normalize padding/margins across cards, headers, modals
	•	Ensure mobile responsiveness on all new components
	8.	📦 Caching & Speed
	•	React Query caching where applicable
	•	Backend optimization for repeated queries
	•	Confirm performance metrics on simulated large datasets
	9.	🧯 Empty/Error States & Fallbacks
	•	Friendly messages for no plans found or filter over-narrowing
	•	Loading skeletons for slow connections
	•	Error fallback for failed data fetches

⸻

✅ Implementation Notes
	•	Modularize everything so features can be reused across health, pet, and auto insurance categories.
	•	Use feature flags if needed to phase rollout.
	•	Maintain clean commits with feature-specific notes.

Once all Phase 3 tasks are complete, we’ll conduct a full QA + visual test across flows.
