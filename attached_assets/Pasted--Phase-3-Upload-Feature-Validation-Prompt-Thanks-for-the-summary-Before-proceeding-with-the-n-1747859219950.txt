// Phase 3 Upload Feature Validation Prompt

/*
Thanks for the summary! Before proceeding with the next step, please answer the following to validate the robustness and maintainability of the current implementation.

1. Backend Endpoint & Service
• Confirm the full file path for the /api/company/plans/upload endpoint
• Where is the plan-upload.ts service located, and is it reused across other routes?
• What file parser are we using (e.g., csv-parser, xlsx, formidable)?
• How is the authenticated user's companyId injected or validated during upload?
• Is there a limit for file size or number of plans per upload?

2. Plan Validation Logic
• Which fields are required across all insurance categories?
• Do we have category-specific rules (e.g., travel vs auto vs health)?
• How are errors returned — per row, per file, or both?
• Where is the shared schema defined — in shared/schema.ts or elsewhere?

3. Security & Access Control
• Is the endpoint protected from unauthorized access?
• Are file extensions and MIME types validated on upload?
• How is malicious content (e.g., macro-embedded Excel files) mitigated?

4. TypeScript & Error Handling
• Are we using shared types from shared/types.ts or new ones declared locally?
• Are null/undefined values checked before saving?
• Are detailed error logs being written to the console or suppressed?

5. Testing & Fallbacks
• What happens if an upload fails mid-process — is it transactional or partial?
• Are invalid rows skipped, or does the whole upload fail?
• How do we handle plan ID collisions (e.g., duplicates in the same file)?

6. Output & Frontend Support
• What response shape is returned to the frontend?
• Does it include success stats, row-level errors, and rejected rows?
• Have we stubbed a frontend UI component yet, or is that the next task?

Once this checklist is validated, we’ll proceed to:
• Implement the React upload component
• Expand validation rules
• Hook analytics and success toasts

Let us know if anything above needs adjustment.
