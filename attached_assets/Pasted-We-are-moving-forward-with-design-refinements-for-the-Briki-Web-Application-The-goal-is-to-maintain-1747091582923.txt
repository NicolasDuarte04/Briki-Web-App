We are moving forward with design refinements for the Briki Web Application. The goal is to maintain the existing beautiful design while dialing back some of the overly futuristic elements and improving symbol aesthetics. I need you to complete the following tasks:

### üåü **1Ô∏è‚É£ Design Refinements Across All Screens**  
**Objective:** Maintain the current modern design but slightly dial back the futuristic aspects for a more professional and refined look.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Review and refine the design for the following screens:  
   - `/home` (Main Screen)  
   - `/trip-info`  
   - `/insurance-plans`  
   - `/checkout`  
   - `/profile`  
   - `/settings`  

2. Apply the following subtle improvements:  
   - Reduce the neon glow effects slightly to be more elegant.  
   - Keep the smooth animations but make them more fluid and less aggressive.  
   - Use polished chrome and soft gradients instead of sharp neon edges.  
   - Maintain modern typography and structured layouts.  

3. Ensure button styling is consistent:  
   - Hover effects and animations should be smooth but not excessive.  
   - Font sizes should be readable and professional.

### üåü **2Ô∏è‚É£ Icon Redesign for Main Categories**  
**Objective:** Update the symbols for Auto, Pet, Travel, and Health categories to be more professional and subtle while keeping the animations.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Replace the current icons with:  
   - **Auto Insurance:** A sleek and polished car icon (less neon, more refined).  
   - **Travel Insurance:** A professional globe or airplane icon with subtle animation.  
   - **Pet Insurance:** A modern paw print or pet silhouette that looks clean and professional.  
   - **Health Insurance:** A simplified cross or stethoscope with smooth movement.  

2. Maintain the **existing animations**, just make them less sharp and more fluid.  
3. Ensure icons are fully responsive and visually aligned with the new aesthetic.

### üåü **3Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile and Desktop Responsiveness Check**  
**Objective:** Verify all adjustments are smooth and responsive.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Test the UI across:  
   - Desktop (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)  
   - Mobile (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)  
2. Fix any alignment or overflow issues found during testing.  
3. Ensure all forms, buttons, and navigation flows are smooth and functional.
