Great work finalizing Phase 2 ‚Äî the Briki platform is now running on a dynamic, API-driven architecture, and the AI Assistant is functioning with real-time insurance plan data. Before we move forward, I‚Äôd like your help reviewing and prioritizing our next development steps.

‚úÖ Phase 2 Confirmation Checklist

Please confirm all the following are now complete and fully functional:
	‚Ä¢	All static plan data removed (e.g., mockPlans.ts)
	‚Ä¢	Travel insurance page now fetches plans dynamically from the backend
	‚Ä¢	Centralized data service implemented in /services/insurance-data-service.ts
	‚Ä¢	AI Assistant now references live data for recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Proper error handling and loading states implemented across views

Once confirmed, let‚Äôs move into Phase 3.

üìå Phase 3 Options ‚Äì What Do You Recommend We Tackle Next?

1. Performance Optimization
	‚Ä¢	Add caching to insurance plan fetches (React Query + API-side)
	‚Ä¢	Implement pagination and lazy loading for large datasets
	‚Ä¢	Virtualize plan lists to improve performance and reduce re-renders

2. UI/UX Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Introduce advanced filtering (coverage amounts, deductible sliders, provider tags)
	‚Ä¢	Add dynamic badges like ‚ÄúBest Value‚Äù or ‚ÄúMost Popular‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Standardize responsiveness and improve layout consistency

3. New Core Features
	‚Ä¢	Begin implementation of checkout/payment flow (mock or real)
	‚Ä¢	Enable quote saving for logged-in users
	‚Ä¢	Add a simplified dashboard for anonymous users to track quote sessions

4. Database Integration
	‚Ä¢	Transition from JSON files to PostgreSQL for long-term scalability
	‚Ä¢	Set up structured DB tables for providers, plans, and quotes
	‚Ä¢	Track quote history and user behavior to improve AI recommendations

5. Deployment & Production Readiness
	‚Ä¢	Environment cleanup and variable management
	‚Ä¢	API rate limiting, input validation, and security improvements
	‚Ä¢	Prepare full deployment pipeline (Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend)

Please:
	1.	Confirm Phase 2 status as ‚úÖ across all key items
	2.	Suggest the best order of execution for Phase 3 tasks
	3.	Let me know if you want me to turn this into a Trello-style board or detailed dev roadmap

We‚Äôre excited to keep building ‚Äî let‚Äôs align on the next sprint!
