Thanks for the detailed diagnostic. Based on your assessment and our business priorities, here’s what we want to tackle next, in this exact order:

⸻

Phase 1 – Core Stability & Comparison Page Fixes

Goal: Eliminate functional blockers and make the /compare-plans screen fully usable.

Tasks:
	1.	Fix the blank screen issue caused by the authentication context on the comparison page.
	2.	Confirm that selected plans persist and render after refresh (validate Zustand + localStorage).
	3.	Ensure proper fallback UI appears if user lands on /compare-plans with no selected plans.

⸻

Phase 2 – Quote Flow Refinement

Goal: Ensure that “Get Quote” buttons simulate a complete quote flow for each plan.

Tasks:
	1.	Design and implement a basic quote summary page or popup (e.g. plan selected + estimated premium + next steps).
	2.	Improve the /insurance/[category]/quote.tsx layout to simulate real UX.
	3.	Add routing feedback (e.g. toast, animation, or success state).

⸻

Phase 3 – AI-Driven & Rule-Based Sorting

Goal: Elevate our comparison engine’s intelligence (even if simulated at first).

Tasks:
	1.	Implement rule-based sorting (e.g. price, co-pay, deductibles).
	2.	Simulate AI recommendations using if/else or scoring logic (e.g. highlight Best for Families, Budget-Friendly).
	3.	Display these tags dynamically based on data — not hardcoded.

⸻

Phase 4 – Analytics & Insights Layer

Goal: Track user behavior to validate product-market fit and improve investor reporting.

Tasks:
	1.	Implement event tracking (plan selected, quote clicked, comparison launched).
	2.	Use Google Analytics or PostHog — or suggest best lightweight setup.
	3.	Store basic anonymized analytics that we can surface later in a dashboard.

⸻

Phase 5 – Scalability Prep

Goal: Begin modularizing Briki’s comparison tech for licensing.

Tasks:
	1.	Decouple the comparison logic and state into a standalone directory (e.g. /modules/compare-engine)
	2.	Define clear input types (insurance plan schema) so it can plug into other data sources (future APIs).
	3.	Optionally, add theming support or config props to make it adaptable to different brands.
