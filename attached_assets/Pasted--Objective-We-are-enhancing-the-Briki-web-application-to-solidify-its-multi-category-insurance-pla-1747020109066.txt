# Questions:
1. Is the *Recently Viewed Plans* section fully integrated with local storage persistence, even after refresh?  
2. Are the *swiper animations* configured for performance optimization on lower-end mobile devices?  
3. Will the *global search bar* in the footer allow category-specific filtering right from the search query?  
4. Are the loader animations handled by **CSS only** or do you plan to integrate **Lottie Animations** for smoother effects?  
5. For the "Best Value" badge in *Compare Plans*, should we allow it to dynamically update if the user adds a new, better plan?

# Expected Output:
- Complete, mobile-responsive, multi-category experience.
- Smooth navigation and category transitions.
- Interactive, swipeable elements for a better user experience.
- Briki branding fully aligned with the new multi-category vision.
