You are now working on **Phase 6** of the Briki AI Assistant development.

This phase focuses on improving the assistant’s reliability, tone, and continuity. We want users to feel like Briki is a consistent, insurance-savvy guide — not just a blank slate chatbot.

---

### Objectives:

1. **Define a Consistent Assistant Personality**
   - Update the system prompt passed to OpenAI to include personality traits:
     Example:
     > You are Briki, an insurance assistant trained to help users understand, compare, and purchase insurance. You are clear, friendly, and knowledgeable — never pushy. You simplify complex ideas and respond with empathy, like a helpful insurance advisor.

   - Apply this tone across all responses, even when explaining difficult topics or limitations

2. **Implement Fallback Handling**
   - If OpenAI returns a vague or off-topic response:
     • Detect it based on confidence or use a fallback keyword flag (e.g., empty content, [default], etc.)
     • Replace with a friendly default message, such as:
       > “I’m not sure how to help with that, but if it’s about insurance, I’ll do my best. Try asking me about travel, pet, or health coverage.”
   - Optionally: allow users to “rephrase question” with a quick tap

3. **Introduce Basic Assistant Memory (Session-Based)**
   - Store recent user context for the current session (in React state or context)
   - Example: if the user says “I want to insure my 8-year-old dog with cancer,” store:
     ```js
     {
       pet_age: 8,
       preexisting_conditions: ["cancer"]
     }
     ```
   - On future questions like “What if he needs surgery?”, include that memory in the backend API call
   - Do **not** persist this memory beyond the session (yet)

4. **Display Memory Awareness in Responses**
   - If the assistant references stored details, make it feel smart:
     > “Since you mentioned your dog is 8 and has cancer, I’d recommend a plan that includes preexisting condition coverage.”

This phase is all about **trust, tone, and continuity** — making Briki feel intelligent, thoughtful, and human-aware.

Once Phase 6 is complete, we’ll move to **Phase 7: Assistant-Driven Navigation + Action Hooks** (e.g., jumping to the quote flow or auto-filling user forms).
