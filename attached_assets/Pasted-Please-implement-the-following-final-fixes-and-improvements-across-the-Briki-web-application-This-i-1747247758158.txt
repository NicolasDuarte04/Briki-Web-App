Please implement the following final fixes and improvements across the Briki web application. This is to finalize the pre-launch version of the platform and prepare it for stable deployment.

---

1. ✅ AUTH ROLE LOGIC & REDIRECTS
- Add a `role` field to the user object during signup: `"user"` or `"company"`.
- After login:
  - Redirect `user` role to the standard B2C interface (`/home`).
  - Redirect `company` role to the Briki Pilot dashboard (`/briki-pilot` or equivalent).
- Ensure this is handled on both the Sign In and Register screens.

---

2. ✅ UNIVERSAL HEADER FIX
- Apply the universal scroll-compatible header (`MainLayout`) across **all B2C pages**:
  - This includes: `/home`, `/plans/travel`, `/plans/auto`, `/plans/pet`, `/plans/health`, etc.
- Remove all legacy navbars (`navbar.tsx`, `navbar-new.tsx`) from these screens.
- Briki Pilot pages (`/company`, `/company-dashboard/*`) should **not** use the global header — they must keep their dedicated dark-styled layout.

---

3. ✅ PLAN PAGE ISSUES
- Fix the navigation buttons in the landing page navbar and footer so they properly route to:
  - `/plans/travel`
  - `/plans/auto`
  - `/plans/pet`
  - `/plans/health`
- Implement `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` when navigating between screens so that users always land at the top of each page.
- Ensure all category screens are styled using the teal-to-navy palette and use consistent font weights and spacing.

---

4. ✅ BRIKI PILOT PREVIEW FIX
- Fix the `TabsContent must be used within Tabs` error in `/company-dashboard/preview`.
- Implement proper `Tabs` + `TabsContent` hierarchy using `shadcn/ui` conventions.

---

5. ✅ PARTNER LOGIN REDIRECT FIX
- The "Partner Login" and "Register as Partner" buttons (from `/company` and `/landing`) currently route to the B2C dashboard.
- Instead, they must redirect:
  - Login → `/company-dashboard`
  - Register → `/company-register` (and post-registration → `/company-dashboard`)

---

6. ✅ STYLE IMPROVEMENTS
- Fix the **"Register as Partner"** button on the `/company` page:
  - Increase text contrast (currently too pale)
  - Adjust font weight and letter spacing to match other CTAs
- Remove unused purple accent styles from old screens
- Ensure all CTA buttons, feature cards, and hero sections across B2C use the **updated blue/teal gradient design**
- Fix font weight consistency across testimonials, feature sections, and hero headlines

---

7. ✅ AUTH SCREEN POLISH
- Fix the input bug in login/register where the **first typed letter is ignored**:
  - Likely due to unmounted input state — ensure `useEffect` initializes form state correctly.
- Reduce vertical white space on Auth screens.
- Apply the same soft blur/gradient background as the landing page for consistency.

---

8. ✅ PERFORMANCE / ANIMATION POLISH
- Resolve any scroll lag or navbar flickering:
  - Unify the animation system (Framer Motion preferred) to prevent double transitions
  - Remove unused `@/components/ui/transition-effect` logic if redundant
- Ensure route transitions between B2C screens are smooth and visually consistent

---

Once this list is complete, we should be ready to:
- Test partner logins
- Validate B2C page routing
- Finalize deployment via Vercel or hosting provider

Let me know if any clarifications are needed before starting!
