You are now working on **Phase 10**, the final phase of the Briki AI Assistant development.

The goal of this phase is to complete final QA, refine the assistant’s tone, and ensure it gracefully handles edge cases, broken flows, and unexpected inputs — all while staying aligned with Briki’s brand voice.

---

### Objectives:

1. **Tone & Personality Finalization**
   - Review recent assistant messages and refine:
     • Tone should remain: friendly, clear, confident, and empathetic
     • No robotic phrasing, no over-apologizing, no filler language
     • Use plain but respectful Spanish or English (depending on app language)
   - Update the system prompt if needed to reinforce tone

2. **Fallback & Error Handling**
   - Ensure all failure points (API errors, invalid user input, OpenAI timeouts) are handled with smart fallback messages:
     > “Hmm, I couldn’t get that just now. Want to try rephrasing or ask something else?”
   - Add visual feedback for errors (e.g., warning bubble, retry button)

3. **Edge-Case Handling**
   - Test interactions like:
     • User sends empty message
     • User sends unrelated questions (e.g., “Tell me a joke”)
     • User repeats the same question multiple times
     • Network or backend failures during request
   - Ensure these don’t crash the chat and always return a clean, helpful message

4. **Accessibility & UX Review**
   - Test full assistant screen on:
     • Mobile (iOS/Android)
     • Tablet and desktop
     • Light/dark modes (if applicable)
   - Check keyboard accessibility, tab navigation, input focus handling

5. **Final Smoke Test**
   - Simulate full flows like:
     • “I want to insure my 9-year-old dog with diabetes” → Briki recommends a plan
     • “What’s a deductible?” → Glossary card appears
     • “I want to start a quote” → Redirects to correct screen

6. **Optional: Add Exit Feedback**
   - Allow users to rate the assistant or leave feedback at the end of a session
     • “Was this helpful?” → Yes / No
     • Text field for suggestions (logged anonymously)

Once this phase is complete, Briki AI Assistant is ready for **public launch or private beta** — a fully working, branded, intelligent assistant that helps people navigate insurance like never before.
