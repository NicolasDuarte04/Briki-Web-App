// ✅ Phase 4 — Full Blog Article Pages Implementation

Hi! Everything looks great so far — the new blog homepage is working beautifully with dynamic featured articles and clean UI.

We’re now ready to move into **Phase 4**, which focuses on building **fully functional blog article pages** when users click on a post.

Please read carefully and **do not start implementing until we give you confirmation**, as we’ll first need your feedback and then prepare the article content accordingly.

---

📌 OBJECTIVE:
When a user clicks on a blog post, it should open a complete, styled article page at `/blog/[slug]`.

---

🛠️ Required Features for This Phase:

1. **Dynamic Route Setup**
   • Create `/pages/blog/[slug].tsx` as a dynamic route
   • Slug should match the article's `slug` field in the backend or JSON

2. **Article Data Fetching**
   • Fetch article data by slug (title, content, author, tags, publish date)
   • Gracefully handle loading and 404 if slug is invalid

3. **Content Rendering**
   • Render full article content using either:
     - Markdown-to-HTML renderer
     - Or a structured rich text parser (headings, paragraphs, links)
   • Support embedded images if possible

4. **Design & Navigation**
   • Match design system and blog homepage style
   • Include title, author, date, tags, reading time, cover image
   • Add a breadcrumb or “← Back to Blog” navigation link

5. **SEO Optimization**
   • Dynamic `<title>`, meta description, OG image (if available)

📦 Additional Questions Before We Proceed:

1. **How many articles should we create for launch?**
   - We want to prepare the right amount of quality content — what’s the ideal initial count for launch and for UI balance?

2. **Do you prefer a markdown format or a WYSIWYG (rich text) setup for article creation/editing?**

3. **For article images:**
   - Should we support image uploads?
   - Or do you prefer a curated folder of stock images?

4. **Who should have access to the blog editor (admin panel)?**
   - All authenticated users?
   - Or just admin-level accounts?

5. **Optional:**
   - Should we add estimated reading time per article?

Once you answer these questions, we’ll get started on preparing the actual article content and confirm when you’re ready to implement.

Thanks again — we’re almost there!
