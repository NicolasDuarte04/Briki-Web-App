You are tasked with implementing a **complete visual and structural makeover** of the Briki Web App, applying a **unified, premium UI** across all main screens. This design should follow the Apple-level aesthetic seen in the attached Figma reference, with clean layout, elegant gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, and a futuristic but calming visual style.

**Visual Style Goals**:
- Use **subtle soft gradients**, **glassmorphism**, and **neutral light palettes**
- All components must be polished with consistent padding, typography, rounded corners, and spacing
- Buttons and cards must follow the **gradient-glow CTA style** seen in the new countdown page
- Animations should use `framer-motion` where appropriate (no overuse, keep performance in mind)
- Eliminate excessive borders, cluttered typography, and outdated visual blocks

---

### GLOBAL STANDARDS TO IMPLEMENT:
- **Typography**: Use modern, smooth font styles with consistent sizing (lg headers, md subhead, sm body)
- **CTA Buttons**: Use `GradientButton` component with hover/press states and directional icons
- **Cards**: Replace all legacy cards with `GlassCard` or custom-glass divs
- **Backgrounds**: Use `AnimatedBackground` across screens with tailored variant intensity per use
- **Icons**: Use `Lucide` or the `Futuristic*Icon` sets only — avoid mixed styles
- **Remove** all redundant styles, non-used states, and outdated font color contrast issues

---

### SCREENS TO OVERHAUL (REFER TO THEIR FILES):

#### @client/src/pages/countdown-page.tsx
- Keep structure from latest update, but fix:
  - Countdown boxes should have **better shadows and spacing**
  - Beta notice still looks visually separate — it must be part of the page hierarchy, smaller, and less intrusive
  - Hero text (`briki`) should animate subtly in scale or opacity
  - Typography across value props needs better alignment and spacing
  - On mobile, ensure full responsiveness (reduce text size and vertical spacing)

#### @client/src/pages/home-page-new.tsx
- This is the **main dashboard** post-login
- Needs complete visual polish:
  - Use same hero section layout as countdown, with gradient header text
  - Replace all insurance category cards with `GlassCard` components
  - Replace feature boxes with the new `FeaturesGrid` used in countdown
  - AI Assistant must only trigger after scroll or interaction, not on load
  - CTA buttons (e.g., “Explore Plans”) need modern `GradientButton` styling
  - Ensure full responsive behavior across all screen sizes
  - AnimatedBackground should use a distinct variant from the countdown page
  - Testimonials section should be added at bottom (reuse structure from `countdown-page-new`)

#### @client/src/pages/auth-page-enhanced.tsx
- Login/register split tabs screen:
  - Use `GlassCard` centered layout
  - Maintain soft pastel gradient background
  - EnhancedInput components should have proper spacing, glowing focus ring
  - Show error states clearly with icon + message (but keep aesthetic clean)
  - Social login buttons: add hover effects and modern icons

#### @client/src/pages/insurance-categories-page.tsx
- Categories screen must match the new visual identity:
  - Full width AnimatedBackground variant
  - Grid of insurance cards should be replaced with the same `GlassCard` format as on Home
  - Page should include a short introductory header + CTA

#### @client/src/pages/insurance-plans.tsx
- This is the plan list view
  - Needs section title with gradient text
  - Plan cards need full UI redesign: `GlassCard`, bold price badge, hover animation
  - Include filters (price, type) in a modern pill-button style at top
  - Bottom CTA bar fixed in mobile view

#### @client/src/pages/checkout.tsx
- Payment screen
  - Step-based layout with soft transitions (e.g., plan summary → personal info → confirm)
  - Highlight chosen plan in a glowing GlassCard
  - Input fields must follow the `EnhancedInput` style
  - Confirmation button must use animated `GradientButton`
  - On success: show glass popup overlay with confetti or check animation

#### @client/src/pages/trip-info.tsx
- Trip info screen:
  - Replace current layout with clean two-column (desktop) or stacked (mobile)
  - Use country pickers with flags and rounded `GlassInput` fields
  - Date pickers should not overflow — use a compact calendar modal
  - Add light animated guidance or hints for better UX

---

### FINAL NOTES:
- Do NOT change any styles inside `briki-pilot-portal.tsx` or B2B files
- All visual updates must follow the reference image provided
- Ensure accessibility: contrast ratios, button focus states, alt text
- Optimize animations and remove any laggy or overlapping transitions
- Clean up any unused imports or deprecated components

**Your mission**: Fully implement the new Briki visual system across all frontend files listed. Keep the UX clean, responsive, and future-ready.

Let me know once the first screen (countdown) is updated so we can review visually before continuing with each screen in sequence.
