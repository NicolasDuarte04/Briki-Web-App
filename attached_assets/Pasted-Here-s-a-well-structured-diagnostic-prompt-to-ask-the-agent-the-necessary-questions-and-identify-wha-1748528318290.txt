Here’s a well-structured diagnostic prompt to ask the agent the necessary questions and identify what might be causing Briki AI to:
	1.	Not render insurance cards properly, and
	2.	Restart or reset the chat after showing recommendations.

🛠 Briki AI Assistant – Diagnostic Questions Prompt

Hi, we’re noticing two critical issues with the Briki AI Assistant and need help identifying the root causes. Please answer the following questions thoroughly without making any code changes yet — we’ll ask for implementations separately.

⸻

🔍 Problem 1: Insurance Cards Not Rendering Properly

Symptoms:
	•	User messages that should trigger plan recommendations (e.g., “Necesito un seguro de viaje para Europa”) are received.
	•	The assistant responds, but insurance plan cards are not shown, or they appear inconsistently.

Questions:
	1.	Could there be a mismatch between the suggestedPlans array returned from the backend and the structure expected in <SuggestedPlans plans={...} />?
	2.	Is the suggestedPlans field present and populated in the assistant’s response object?
	3.	Is the render condition in NewBrikiAssistant.tsx:

{!isUser && message.suggestedPlans && message.suggestedPlans.length > 0}

ever failing due to data format issues, undefined values, or serialization problems?

	4.	Are there recent changes in how plan objects are structured (e.g., missing required props like id, title, price, etc.) that might be silently breaking rendering?

⸻

🔄 Problem 2: Assistant Resets or Forgets Context

Symptoms:
	•	After showing suggested plans once, the assistant “forgets” the context or resets, treating follow-up messages like “¿Cuál es mejor?” as if the user had said something unrelated.

Questions:
	1.	Is conversationHistory being built correctly to include both:
	•	The assistant’s previous response including plan suggestions
	•	The user’s previous messages?
	2.	Are we accidentally resetting userContext or messages state at any point during a new message cycle?
	3.	Is there any chance that a re-render or unexpected useEffect is clearing the message array or suggestedPlans after each interaction?
	4.	Could there be a bug in formatUserContext() or extractContextFromMessage() that’s unintentionally wiping previous context?
	5.	Are you injecting suggestedPlans or references to previously recommended plans into the system prompt or assistant message history?

Please review and answer all the above to help us understand exactly where things are breaking. Once we know the answers, we’ll proceed with targeted fixes.

Let me know once your diagnosis is complete.
