# Objective:
We want to elevate the Briki web application to reflect its *AI-driven, futuristic, and revolutionary approach* to insurance. The design should be sleek, interactive, and visually represent Briki's smart technology and multi-category offerings (Travel, Auto, Pet, and Health).

---

# Tasks:
## 1️⃣ Landing Page Overhaul:
- Replace the current **background image** with a more **futuristic, AI-driven visual**:
  - Examples: Digital cityscapes, AI-powered interfaces, holographic policy displays.
  - A design that showcases insurance as a futuristic, data-driven experience.
- Redesign the *Insurance Categories* section:
  - Remove generic stock images.
  - Replace with futuristic, stylized icons that represent:
    - Travel → Digital globe with holographic flight paths.
    - Auto → 3D-rendered autonomous vehicles with data overlays.
    - Pet → Digital pet profiles with health and coverage stats.
    - Health → Interactive health data visualizations.
- Add **micro-animations** to cards:
  - Slight hover effects with 3D scaling.
  - Interactive glow when hovered for better user feedback.

---

## 2️⃣ Typography & Spacing Update:
- Replace the current font with a more **futuristic and modern typography**.
- Adjust spacing for:
  - Main headers (e.g., "Insurance Simplified").
  - Buttons ("Get Started", "Learn More") with a *soft glow hover effect*.
  - Category cards for better alignment and flow.

---

## 3️⃣ Button Design:
- Enhance the buttons to be more interactive:
  - Add gradient transitions on hover (e.g., light blue to dark blue for "Get Started").
  - Include **micro-animations** (e.g., a slight ripple effect when clicked).
  - Add a subtle **shadow effect** to elevate the buttons from the background.

---

## 4️⃣ Sign Up Page Update:
- Replace the left-side form background with a **gradient overlay** for a more modern look.
- Icons for Travel, Auto, Pet, and Health should:
  - Have slight **3D shadowing** for depth.
  - Glow softly on hover to feel interactive.
  - Use gradient fills instead of flat colors.

---

## 5️⃣ AI Representation & Interactivity:
- Add interactive **data visualizations**:
  - A policy comparison animation: cards floating and rearranging as users click.
  - Animated data charts showing real-time recommendations.
  - Smart coverage suggestions visualized in *real-time* as users enter information.
- Add a **small interactive AI assistant icon** that appears with tips during the Sign-Up process.

---

## 6️⃣ Smooth Transition Animations:
- Ensure that transitions between:
  - Landing Page → Category Page
  - Category Page → Plan Comparison
  - Plan Comparison → Checkout
- Use **Framer Motion** for slide and fade effects with a futuristic touch.

# Questions:
1. Can you create **interactive 3D icons** for the four main categories?  
2. Should the **background of the landing page** have subtle moving animations (e.g., slow particle drift or soft holographic waves)?  
3. Are you able to implement **interactive hover effects** for buttons and cards that feel futuristic?  
4. Should the *micro-animations* be optimized for mobile as well, or only for desktop?  
5. Can we add a **soft glow effect** to the navbar links to match the futuristic theme?  

---

# Expected Output:
- A polished, futuristic, AI-driven design that reflects Briki’s new vision.
- Seamless animations and interactive elements that feel modern and revolutionary.
- Clear visual identity that differentiates Briki from traditional insurance platforms.
- Responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
