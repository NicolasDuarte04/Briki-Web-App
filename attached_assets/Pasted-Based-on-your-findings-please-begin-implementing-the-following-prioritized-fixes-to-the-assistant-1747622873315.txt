Based on your findings, please begin implementing the following prioritized fixes to the `/assistant` screen:

---

### 1. Remove Duplicate Navigation Header
- Remove the sticky top navigation component from the assistant screen
- Keep only the scroll-based header that appears when the user scrolls up
- Ensure the remaining header has proper spacing, z-index, and doesn't overlap page content

---

### 2. Switch to AuthenticatedLayout for Structural Consistency
- Replace the current custom layout with `AuthenticatedLayout`
- Wrap the entire assistant screen with this layout to ensure consistent spacing, padding, and behavior with the rest of the app
- Make sure layout containers don’t conflict with scroll logic or fixed input behavior

---

### 3. Fix Input Bar Positioning
- Anchor the chat input field to the **bottom of the screen**
- Make the input bar `position: fixed` or equivalent in Tailwind, so it remains visible at all times
- Let the message history scroll independently above it
- Ensure that the input bar does not shift when new messages arrive

---

### 4. Add Default Assistant Conversation on First Load
- Inject a sample interaction on first load to demonstrate Briki’s capabilities
- Suggested example:

  > **User:** I’m freelance and need health insurance that covers emergencies and checkups.  
  > **Briki AI:** I found two flexible plans that include ER visits, virtual care, and no long-term contracts. Want to take a look?

- Add typing indicator after user message  
- Display a sample plan card (e.g. “FlexHealth Basic”)

---

### 5. Replace Generic Assistant Icon with Briki Brand Icon
- Replace the robot avatar with the branded "B" icon used on the landing page
- Apply it consistently across all assistant message components

---

### 6. Update Message Styling for Brand Consistency
- Use Briki's primary blue gradient for assistant bubble highlights
- Style error messages with light red background (`bg-red-50`) and `text-red-800`
- Use Tailwind's spacing, rounding, and font weight utilities to unify appearance
- Apply consistent padding (`px-4 py-3`) to all messages

Once this batch is complete, we’ll move on to fixing OpenAI quota issues and adding visual polish to recommendation cards.
