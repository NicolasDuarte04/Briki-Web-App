You are now working on **Phase 4 of the Briki public site restructure**.

This phase focuses on elevating the visual experience of the public-facing pages by adding subtle animations, ambient background effects, and interactive feedback to improve perceived quality and user engagement.

---

### Objectives:

1. **Implement Ambient Background Effects**
   - For `/features`, `/ask-briki`, and `/careers`:
     • Add a subtle animated gradient background or motion visualizer
     • Use CSS or canvas effects with performance in mind
     • Options:
       - Slowly shifting background gradient (e.g., using Tailwind + keyframes)
       - Floating particle animation layer behind content (SVG or canvas)
       - Glassmorphism-style blurred light panels behind hero text
   - Background should be visually calming and on-brand (teal, blue, soft glow — not distracting)

2. **Add Scroll-Triggered Animations**
   - Use a library like `framer-motion` or simple Tailwind utility classes to trigger animations as users scroll
   - Animate elements like:
     • Feature cards (fade in or slide up)
     • Testimonials or steps in “How Briki Works”
     • Blog and Forum post cards (hover and fade reveal)
   - Keep animations subtle and responsive

3. **Enhance Hover & Tap Interactions**
   - Add motion or scale effects on:
     • Taskbar links
     • CTA buttons
     • Plan cards or info cards (if present)
   - Use Tailwind transitions and transforms to create clean micro-interactions

4. **Unify Visual Rhythm**
   - Review all paddings, line-heights, and spacing to ensure consistent rhythm across sections
   - Use Tailwind tokens (`space-y`, `gap`, `leading`) to improve scannability
   - Apply consistent section breaks with soft dividers or gradient fades where needed

5. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Ensure that animations and background visuals degrade gracefully on mobile
   - Avoid GPU-intensive effects on smaller devices

This phase is focused on polish, subtlety, and visual intelligence — it should feel seamless, calming, and professional.

Once complete, we will move to **Phase 5: Refined content pass (copy improvements, testimonials, Q&A depth, SEO headlines).**
