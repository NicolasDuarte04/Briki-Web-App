### Briki for Companies – Partner Experience Simulation

We are now ready to implement a **dedicated Briki experience for insurance providers and potential partners**. This should be **visually distinct** from the main consumer app and reflect a clean, professional, data-focused dashboard environment.

Please reply with a paragraph summarizing your understanding of this request and wait for confirmation before starting implementation.

### 🎯 Goal

Create a **new screen, login flow, and dashboard interface** that simulates what an insurance company would see if they partnered with Briki. This is for **demo purposes**, but should look functional and impressive.

---

### 1. Partner Entry Point (New Button & Navigation)

- Add a new **“For Companies”** or **“Partners”** button in the main app navigation or landing menu
- When clicked, this should take the user to a **visually different screen** (e.g. `/company`)
- The screen should include:
  - **Log in as a Company** → `/company-login`
  - **Register as a Company** → `/company-register`
  - **Contact Sales** CTA → opens a form or redirects to contact section

---

### 2. Company Auth Flow

- Reuse the existing auth system but create separate routes:
  - `/company-login`
  - `/company-register`
- After login/register, redirect the user to the new **Partner Dashboard** interface
- Apply a `user.role = 'company'` or similar flag to separate the flow visually and functionally

---

### 3. Partner Dashboard (Simulated MVP)

After login, show the **Company Dashboard** view (new layout and styling).

#### a. Visual Style:
- Use a **clean white + sky blue + silver palette**
- Subtle glassmorphism (blurred panels, floating cards)
- Smooth, elegant animations (not as futuristic or gradient-heavy as user UI)
- Clear data-focused layout with charts, cards, and tabs

#### b. Simulated Modules:

**1. Lead Analytics (Simulated Data)**
- Metric cards:
  - Daily Active Users
  - Insurance Plan Clicks
  - Quote Interest Submissions
- Chart: "Top Plan Types Searched"
- Map or table: User interest by region (e.g., Colombia, Mexico)

**2. Plan Quoting Simulator**
- Upload dummy CSV or input plan name, price, coverage values
- Show preview of what the plan would look like inside Briki (card view + AI Assistant view)

**3. Placement Preview**
- Show how their plan would appear:
  - In plan comparison screen
  - As a featured banner
  - In an AI assistant response

**4. “Request a Pilot” CTA Section**
- Short form:
  - Company Name, Country
  - Plan Types (checkboxes)
  - Message
- Optional file upload for branding/logo

---

### 4. Navigation Differences

- Create a separate **company-only navigation menu**
  - "Dashboard"
  - "Upload Quote"
  - "Preview Placement"
  - "Request Pilot"
- This menu should only be visible after logging in as a company

---

### 5. Optional Tabs (Non-Functional for Now)

- “API Integration”
- “Billing & Invoicing”
- “Support & FAQ”

These can be placeholders but should suggest Briki is a serious B2B platform.

---

### 📦 Deliverables

- `/company` entry screen with unique visual style
- Separate `/company-login` and `/company-register` flow
- Partner Dashboard with simulated analytics and placement preview
- Visually distinct UI from consumer flow
- Company-specific menu and routing logic
- Basic responsive layout for desktop and mobile
