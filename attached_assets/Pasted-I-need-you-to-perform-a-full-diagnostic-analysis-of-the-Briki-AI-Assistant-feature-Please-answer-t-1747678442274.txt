I need you to perform a full diagnostic analysis of the Briki AI Assistant feature.

Please answer the following questions in detail so we can clearly understand the current architecture, limitations, and what must be done to make the assistant fully functional and production-ready.

1. **Does the Briki AI Assistant currently send requests to the OpenAI API?**
   - If yes, which file handles that communication?
   - Is the API key correctly configured and securely stored?
   - Is it using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5?

2. **Where is the user input handled?**
   - Which file contains the logic for handling user messages (e.g., `handleChatMessage()` or similar)?
   - What steps are taken after a user submits a question? Is it passed through OpenAI directly or routed through an internal service?

3. **Are the assistant’s responses currently dynamic or hardcoded?**
   - If dynamic, does it retrieve real-time responses from OpenAI?
   - If hardcoded or mocked, where is that data coming from?

4. **Is the assistant integrated with Briki’s insurance plan data?**
   - Can it recommend actual insurance plans from the app’s catalog?
   - If not, what data does it currently have access to?

5. **What would need to be done to allow the assistant to recommend real insurance options from our dataset?**
   - Could we use embeddings and semantic search?
   - Is the plan data accessible through an internal API or local database?
   - What files should we modify or create?

6. **How are AI conversations stored or tracked (if at all)?**
   - Are user questions and answers stored in a database or local cache?
   - Can we log and improve responses based on user feedback?

7. **What would be the recommended path to make the assistant truly intelligent and useful — both from a technical and UX standpoint?**

Please structure your response with filenames, code locations, and a high-level action plan. We're aiming to make this feature fully functional before an investor demo, and we need to know exactly what’s working, what’s not, and what’s missing.

Thanks.
