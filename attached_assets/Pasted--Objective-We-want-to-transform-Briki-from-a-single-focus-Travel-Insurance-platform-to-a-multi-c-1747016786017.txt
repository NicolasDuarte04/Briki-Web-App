# Objective:
We want to transform Briki from a single-focus Travel Insurance platform to a **multi-category insurance marketplace**. This includes:
- Travel Insurance (already functional)
- Auto Insurance (new)
- Pet Insurance (new)
- Health Insurance (new)

The design and navigation should follow the concept of "Rappi-style categories," where users can easily switch between insurance types through smooth navigation and interactive category cards.

# Tasks:
## 1️⃣ Navbar Update:

---

## 2️⃣ Homepage Redesign:
- Add horizontal scrollable sections for each category:
  - Travel Insurance (existing setup)
  - Auto Insurance
  - Pet Insurance
  - Health Insurance
- Each section should display top plans in a scrollable format with:
  - Icons
  - Coverage Highlights
  - Price
  - CTA buttons (*Get a Quote*, *Learn More*)

## 5️⃣ Comparison Logic:

    - *Price Difference*
    - *Coverage Limits*
    - *Exclusions*
    - *Special Benefits*

## 6️⃣ New Insurance Plan Pages:
- Create distinct pages for:
  - Auto Insurance
  - Pet Insurance
  - Health Insurance
- Each page should have:
  - Category-Specific Icon
  - Search Filters
  - Interactive Cards
  - "Compare Plans" button
  
---

## 7️⃣ Visual Enhancements:
- Consistent design across all categories.
- Branded icons for each category.
- Animations for smoother navigation.
- Dynamic page transitions between categories.

---

## 8️⃣ Future Scalability:
- Structure the navigation and category layout to allow for *Life Insurance* in the future without major redesigns.
- Ensure components are reusable to easily add new categories.

# Questions:
1. Should mock data be generated for Auto, Pet, and Health categories, or do you want me to integrate it with placeholder JSON files?
2. Do you want the search bar to have category-specific search logic (e.g., auto-completion for pet breeds, car models, etc.)?
3. Should we maintain the current color scheme and typography, or do you want it redesigned for multi-category scaling?

---

# Expected Output:
- Multi-category navigation with seamless switching between Travel, Auto, Pet, and Health.
- Category-specific pages with interactive elements and filtering.
- Consistent UI experience with "Rappi-style" navigation.
- Scalable structure for future categories.
