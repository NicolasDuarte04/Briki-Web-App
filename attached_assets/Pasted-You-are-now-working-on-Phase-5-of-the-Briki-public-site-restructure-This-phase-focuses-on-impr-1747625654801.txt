You are now working on **Phase 5 of the Briki public site restructure**.

This phase focuses on improving the written content across all public pages. The goal is to align everything with Briki’s brand voice: clear, confident, approachable, and insurance-smart — while also optimizing for scannability and search engines.

### Objectives:

1. **Apply Briki's Voice Across All Public Pages**
   - Tone should be:
     • Friendly but sharp (not robotic)
     • Simple and jargon-free
     • Decisive and knowledgeable
     • Slightly informal but professional
   - Update the following screens with improved copy:
     • `/features` – highlight the product's value clearly
     • `/ask-briki` – rewrite Q&A to sound more conversational and helpful
     • `/pricing` – clarify cost, value, and how Briki earns money
     • `/careers` – make working at Briki sound exciting and meaningful

2. **Refine Headlines and Section Titles**
   - Make all main headlines bolder and more engaging
   - Use short, action-oriented language:
     • “Understand insurance in seconds”
     • “Briki compares, so you don’t have to”
     • “Talk to an assistant that actually knows insurance”

3. **Improve CTAs**
   - Replace generic buttons like “Learn More” or “Start” with more direct, goal-driven actions:
     • “Try Briki Free”
     • “Compare Plans Now”
     • “Ask Briki a Question”
     • “Get a Quote”

4. **Add SEO-Optimized Metadata and H1 Tags**
   - Make sure every page has:
     • A unique, relevant H1
     • Keyword-rich subtitles where applicable
     • Meta titles and descriptions for SEO (can be placeholder text for now)

     Example for `/features`:
     - H1: “Understand and compare insurance in seconds”
     - Meta Title: “Briki Features – AI-Powered Insurance Comparison”
     - Meta Description: “See how Briki uses AI to help you compare travel, auto, pet, and health insurance in real time. No jargon. Just clarity.”

5. **Improve Visual Hierarchy of Text**
   - Ensure all headers, subheaders, and paragraphs are readable
   - Use Tailwind typography utilities to improve spacing and weight
   - Add `prose` styling or equivalent for long-form sections (blog, FAQ)

This phase is all about content clarity, brand strength, and reader trust.

Once complete, we will move to **Phase 6: Public accessibility, performance, and Lighthouse cleanup (final pass before launch)**.
