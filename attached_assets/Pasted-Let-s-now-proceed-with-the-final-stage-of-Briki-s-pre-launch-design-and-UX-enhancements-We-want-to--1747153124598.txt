Let’s now proceed with the final stage of Briki’s pre-launch design and UX enhancements. We want to apply the new visual color system and icon set (based on the uploaded reference image), and also prepare the platform for a public Instagram-facing demo. These updates will improve user appeal, engagement, and feedback collection.

---

### 1. 🎨 Visual Overhaul (Gradient & Aesthetic Theme)

**Goal:** Shift the current light/purple style to the more immersive, premium gradient shown in the attached image (teal, indigo, deep blue, violet). This will serve as our final design tone for demo launch.

**Tasks:**
- Replace all page backgrounds, overlays, and gradients with the new palette
- Ensure font colors contrast correctly (white/light cyan on darker backgrounds)
- Apply this theme across all UI components: inputs, cards, buttons, and hover effects
- Use radial glow, soft gradients, and animated transitions to maintain Apple-like elegance

### 2. 🧩 Custom Icon System (From Scratch)

**Goal:** Replace all current category icons (Travel, Auto, Pet, Health) with **completely new Apple-style icons**.

**Tasks:**
- Design original minimalist SVG icons (rounded, fluid, clean)
- Ensure each icon animates subtly on hover
- Icons should match the gradient glow and polish of the new theme
- Icons must scale well across devices

---

### 3. 🧪 Feedback Collection (Pre-Launch Demo Purpose)

**Goal:** Collect feedback from early demo users accessing through Instagram and other sources.

**Tasks:**
- Add a **floating feedback button** visible across all screens (bottom right)
- Create a feedback modal with:
  - UI, Navigation, and Overall Experience ratings
  - 1–2 open-ended questions (“What would you improve?” / “What feature do you wish we had?”)
- Store this feedback securely or prepare to email it to our admin inbox (basic form submission logic)

---

### 4. 🚀 Polish the Landing / Countdown Screen

**Goal:** Turn the timer screen into a more engaging marketing entry point.

**Tasks:**
- Add **social media sharing buttons** (Instagram, LinkedIn)
- Add an **email field**: “Notify me when Briki officially launches”
- If possible, include an animated header or short demo loop (GIF/video placeholder is fine for now)

---

### 5. 📱 Mobile Optimization Pass

**Goal:** Guarantee the entire demo works beautifully on mobile, especially for Instagram users.

**Tasks:**
- Review all category pages and forms on iPhone + Android resolutions
- Ensure spacing, taps, transitions, and inputs are mobile-friendly
- Confirm that gradients and icons scale gracefully

---

### 6. 💡 Optional Enhancements (if time permits)

- Subtle tooltips or animated hints on AI assistant and navigation buttons
- A “Coming Soon” section in the footer with checkmarks or icons for upcoming features (e.g., Pet Quotes, AI Risk Advisors)
- Analytics tracking hooks (e.g., most clicked category, AI usage, feedback submissions)
