You are now working on **Phase 2 of the Briki public site restructure**.

In this phase, you will focus on designing and implementing the content and layout for two key pages:
- `/features`
- `/ask-briki`

These should be scrollable, mobile-friendly, and visually aligned with Briki’s brand (clean, modern, tech-forward).

---

### Objectives:

1. **Enhance `/features` Page**
   - Use the `PublicLayout`
   - Build a multi-section scrollable layout with the following blocks:
     • Hero section with a bold headline (e.g., “Insurance Made Understandable”) and short subtitle
     • Three key feature cards (horizontal or vertical layout):
       - AI-Powered Plan Comparison
       - Simple, Visual Explanations
       - Fast Checkout in Seconds
     • Visual explainer (could be a horizontal timeline or step-by-step with icons) for “How it Works”
     • Trusted by logos or placeholder testimonials (fake for now)
     • CTA: “Try Briki Free” or “Log in to get your quote”
   - Optional: Add an **ambient background visual effect** (animated gradient, blur, or light effect behind the hero section)

2. **Design `/ask-briki` as a Static FAQ/AI Preview Page**
   - Use `PublicLayout`
   - Make it feel like a real assistant chat, but **static only** (no backend connection here)
   - Layout:
     • Hero section: “Ask Briki Anything About Insurance” + short description
     • Simulated chat-style Q&A preview:
       - Q: “What is travel insurance?”
         A: “Travel insurance helps cover unexpected events on your trip, such as medical emergencies or cancellations…”
       - Q: “Can I insure my dog with pre-existing conditions?”
         A: “Yes, but policies may vary. Briki can help compare options that include pre-existing coverage.”
     • CTA: “Log in to use the full Briki Assistant”

3. **Styling & Interactivity**
   - Use TailwindCSS and ShadCN components
   - Include animated or interactive elements only where appropriate (e.g., hover cards, scroll fade-ins)
   - Design should remain light, fast, and accessible on mobile and desktop

You do not need to implement real data fetching or assistant logic in this phase — just create visual structure and branded content for these pages.

Once complete, we will continue to **Phase 3: Blog, Forum, and Careers content layout.**
