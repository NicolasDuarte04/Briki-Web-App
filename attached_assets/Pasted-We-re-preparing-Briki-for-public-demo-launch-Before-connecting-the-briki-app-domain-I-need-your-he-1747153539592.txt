We’re preparing Briki for public demo launch. Before connecting the briki.app domain, I need your help confirming the current readiness of the following launch-related features.

Please go through this checklist and answer with the current status of each. Based on your answers, we’ll determine what to implement next.

### ✅ Deployment Readiness Checklist

#### 1. Email Capture Setup
- [ ] Is there a working email capture field in the app (e.g. on countdown or home screen)?
- [ ] Does it store the email or send it to a service (e.g. Formspree, Mailchimp, Google Sheet)?
- [ ] If yes, where is the captured data going currently?

#### 2. Feedback Collection Form
- [ ] Is there a feedback form accessible from all pages (e.g. floating button)?
- [ ] Does it include:
  - UI, Navigation, and Experience ratings?
  - Open-ended questions (e.g. "What would you improve?")
- [ ] Where does this feedback get stored or sent?

#### 3. Analytics Integration
- [ ] Is any analytics tool currently integrated? (Google Analytics, Plausible, PostHog, etc.)
- [ ] If yes, which provider is used and how is it being loaded in the app?
- [ ] Are key events tracked (e.g. category views, AI assistant use, login success)?

#### 4. OpenGraph Metadata (Social Sharing Optimization)
- [ ] Are OpenGraph tags set for the site? (title, description, image)
- [ ] What does the current sharing preview look like when Briki is linked in WhatsApp or Instagram bios?

#### 5. Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Have all pages (including category pages and auth) been tested on mobile?
- [ ] Are layouts responsive and touch interactions smooth on both iOS and Android?
- [ ] Any known issues with specific screen sizes?

#### 6. Final UI/UX Sweep
- [ ] Are all icons updated to the new Apple-style gradient versions?
- [ ] Is the new visual tone (gradient background like the reference image) applied across all screens?
- [ ] Does the assistant no longer pop up automatically?
