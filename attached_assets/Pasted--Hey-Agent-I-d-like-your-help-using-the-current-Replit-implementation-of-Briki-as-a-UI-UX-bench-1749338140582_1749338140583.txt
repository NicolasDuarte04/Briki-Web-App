👋 Hey Agent, I’d like your help using the current Replit implementation of Briki as a **UI/UX benchmark** for our migration to Cursor.

Our goal is to rebuild the Briki insurance assistant with:
- A stunning, mobile-first UI (Apple-like, elegant)
- A clean structure (atomic, scalable)
- A beautiful landing page (think Stripe/Linear quality)
- A fully working chat interface with plan recommendations

---

## 📌 Please answer these specific questions based on our current Replit app:

### 🧠 1. **Visual & Layout System**
- How would you describe the **overall design system** of this app?
  - What makes it look good?
  - What Tailwind patterns, spacing, or components are we using?
- What are the **core UI components** that define Briki’s aesthetic?
- Is there any specific file, section, or pattern you recommend **preserving** or **replicating** during the migration?

---

### 🔧 2. **Component Architecture**
- Do we currently follow an **atomic design structure**? (ui/, layout/, features/)
- If not, what would you recommend to make it easier to maintain inside a Next.js 14 app?
- How are common UI pieces (e.g., PlanCards, buttons, sections) organized?

---

### 🎨 3. **Branding & Styling**
- What fonts, shadows, and gradients are we using that give it this professional feel?
- How is the color palette managed?
- Are there any files or tokens controlling typography and spacing?

---

### 🧱 4. **Layout & Responsiveness**
- Is our layout system truly **mobile-first**?
- How is responsiveness handled in each page?
- What files or patterns handle that best?

---

### 💬 5. **AI Assistant Flow**
- How is the AI assistant logic connected to the UI in this version?
- What files control:
  - Message display
  - Plan recommendation rendering
  - Assistant context/question flow

---

## 🙏 Final Question
Can you give us a **UI migration guideline** based on this Replit project?
- What would you recommend copying over or referencing as inspiration?
- Are there any common mistakes we should avoid when re-implementing this in Cursor?

We’ll use your answers to guide our next steps with the Cursor agent. Thanks in advance!
