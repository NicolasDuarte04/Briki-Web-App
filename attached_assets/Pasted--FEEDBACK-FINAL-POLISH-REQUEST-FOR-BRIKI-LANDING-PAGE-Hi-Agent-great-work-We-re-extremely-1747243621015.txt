// ✅ FEEDBACK + FINAL POLISH REQUEST FOR BRIKI LANDING PAGE

Hi Agent — great work!

We’re extremely happy with the new landing page. Here’s what we *really love* and want to keep exactly as-is:

• The overall visual structure — it’s clean, modern, and aligns perfectly with Briki’s branding
• The use of **blue gradient tones** in the consumer section and **navy blue** for B2B — this dual tone strategy looks professional
• The **scroll behavior** is smooth and well-paced
• The **“Insurance Companies: Supercharge Your Distribution”** section is one of our favorite parts — visually stunning and strategically placed
• The **countdown timer** is beautifully styled and perfectly positioned in the flow — no changes needed

That said, we’ve noticed a few small bugs and polish items to resolve before full release. Here is the complete implementation plan:

// --- START FIX LIST ---

1. FIX NAVIGATION BAR OVERLAP
• Problem: There appear to be **two overlapping nav bars** at the top when the page loads — causing content (e.g. logo and buttons) to stack or flicker
• Fix: Remove the unused original nav version and keep a single sticky header
• Add: `className="sticky top-0 z-50 backdrop-blur-md bg-white/60 shadow transition"`

2. REDUCE TOP WHITE SPACE
• Problem: The **hero section has a bit too much pure white**
• Fix: Apply a soft **radial gradient background** or faint decorative animation (icons or glow dots)
• Goal: Add early visual depth without disrupting the typography

3. EXTEND BRAND COLOR VISUALS TO HERO
• Problem: The beautiful navy/teal only starts midway down the page
• Fix: Consider **extending part of the color scheme up into the hero or CTA section** using a subtle fade

4. MAINTAIN COUNTDOWN AS-IS
• Note: The countdown block looks **perfect** — keep its placement, animation, and styling

5. FIX LOW CONTRAST TEXT IN B2B SECTION
• Problem: The text “**Supercharge Your Distribution**” is too dark against the navy background
• Fix: Change to:
  → `text-white` or `text-blue-300`  
  → or apply a slight `drop-shadow-md` for contrast

6. OPTIONAL (ONLY IF TIME): TYPOGRAPHY & NAV POLISH
• Unify nav font sizes / spacing
• Ensure button padding and corner radii match globally

// --- END FIX LIST ---

Once these items are updated, the page is ready for public launch and investor-ready presentation.

Please confirm once these are complete. Thanks again — amazing job!
