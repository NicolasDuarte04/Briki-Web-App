### Phase 2 – Unified Visual Polish & Component Refinement (Steps 4 & 5)

We’re ready to move into the next phase of Briki’s design evolution. Thank you for the refinements so far — the login experience is much cleaner now. Here’s what to implement next:

---

### 1. UI Balance Between Screens (Step 4)
- Create a **more unified design language** across consumer screens (homepage, login, plan pages) while preserving their **distinct identities**.
- Maintain a **welcoming, animated, and fluid feel** for consumer pages (Home, Explore, Compare).
- In contrast, the **company/enterprise interface** should continue using a **sleek, glassy, data-focused theme** (white/silver tones, futuristic UI).

> Maintain soft transitions when navigating between consumer and company sides to feel like different wings of the same platform, not two different sites.

---

### 2. Component Redesign & Styling Priorities (Step 5)
Please apply upgraded visuals to the following key areas:

#### a. Navigation Bar
- Increase contrast between active/inactive links
- Add soft hover transitions
- Add a **quick feedback icon or toggle** near the profile area for future onboarding

#### b. Buttons
- **Replace the current purple CTA button (`#A64EFF`)** with a more harmonious tone:
  - Use a **gradient**: `#4C6EF5 → #5F99F7` for the “Sign In”, “Pre-Test the App”, and other key CTAs
  - On hover: subtle lift animation + inner glow

#### c. Logo / Brand Wordmark
- The **“Briki” heading currently uses the same purple tone**. It looks slightly out of place with the new gradient background.
  - Suggested replacement: solid `#5D5FEF` or similar indigo-blue that blends better with the overall color scheme.

#### d. Plan Cards
- Use glass-like cards with light shadow, smoother borders, and micro-animations on hover
- Highlight coverage stats or pricing in a badge-style element

#### e. Forms (Login, Register, Feedback)
- Upgrade all form components to feel like native macOS/iOS inputs (glass, subtle shadows, smooth focus state)

#### f. Footer
- Unify design with soft border-top, social links (Instagram, LinkedIn), and a beta-mode notice

### 3. Briki Co-Pilot & Home Screen Update
- Improve the **Home Screen** navigation — it still feels too generic
  - Add gentle interactive sections, “Explore Now” hover motion, scroll-based transitions
- The **Briki Co-Pilot AI button** should be more inviting:
  - Add subtle breathing animation when idle
  - Add a new floating behavior on desktop view
  - Optional: voice input animation (waveform style) when user activates the bot

### 4. Color Theory Clarification
Please move away from the flat, synthetic purple (#A64EFF) — it doesn’t pair well with the refined background gradient. We want a balance of energy and trust.

Suggested new color set:
- **Primary Buttons**: `#4C6EF5 → #5F99F7`
- **Secondary Accent**: `#00C2FF`
- **Headings / Brand Text**: `#5D5FEF` or similar modern indigo

Let us know if you need updated branding specs or want us to upload a finalized design token sheet.
