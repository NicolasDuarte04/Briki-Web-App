# Questions:
## 1️⃣ Horizontal Scroll Implementation:

## 2️⃣ Custom Loader Animation:

  - Rotating effects?
  - Fading transitions?
  - Or something else?

## 3️⃣ Recently Viewed Plans:
- For the *Recently Viewed Plans* section:
  - Do you want a limit on the number of items displayed? (e.g., the last 5 plans only)
  - Should these plans be swipeable horizontally on mobile?
  - Will you manage this with **React Context** or **Redux** for state persistence?

## 5️⃣ Search Bar Logic:

  - Are you planning to fetch search results dynamically or use local filtering?

---

## 7️⃣ Mobile Responsiveness:
- For the mobile swipe behavior:
  - Are you optimizing it for **iOS Safari**, **Chrome Mobile**, and **Android Native Browser**?
