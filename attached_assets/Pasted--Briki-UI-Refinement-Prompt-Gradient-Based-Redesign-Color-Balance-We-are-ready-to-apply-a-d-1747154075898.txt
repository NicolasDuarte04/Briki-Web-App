### Briki UI Refinement Prompt: Gradient-Based Redesign + Color Balance

We are ready to apply a **design refinement** to the Briki Web Application that shifts our current dark-dominant UI to a **cleaner, more elegant and welcoming aesthetic**, based on the **attached gradient reference images**.

> This is **not** a structural redesign â€” the layout, flow, and animations must be preserved.  
> Our goal is to **update the visual tone, background colors, icons, and balance** across all views for a more sophisticated yet soft AI-inspired look.

### ðŸŽ¨ Scope of Work

#### 1. Theme Transition â€“ Dark to Luminous AI-Gradient Design

**Goal:** Replace the current black-heavy palette with a **gradient-friendly, lighter design language** based on the two uploaded references (cool violet/blue and soft teal/black blends).

**Requirements:**
- Replace dark backgrounds with lighter **gradient-based backgrounds** (see images).
- Use soft lighting effects and blur transitions (Apple-style).
- Ensure **color balance** â€” background, font, icons, buttons, forms, shadows must blend naturally.
- Avoid stark contrasts or heavy outlines â€” everything should feel seamless, slightly futuristic, but highly readable.

---

#### 2. Category Page Updates

Update the following pages to use the **exact same design system** as the new home and countdown pages:

- Travel Insurance
- Auto Insurance
- Pet Insurance
- Health Insurance

**Each screen must:**
- Adopt the new gradient-based background
- Use soft UI elements (cards, shadows, rounded buttons)
- Be mobile-optimized and visually cohesive

---

#### 3. Icon & Symbol Update

Weâ€™ve already created new iconography that matches Appleâ€™s minimalism â€” please integrate those instead of the current overly futuristic ones.

**Tasks:**
- Replace current animated insurance icons (travel, pet, health, auto)
- Use updated icons provided (cleaner, minimal Apple-style)
- Ensure **animations remain** and transition effects stay fluid
- Match icon tone to gradient backgrounds â€” no harsh brightness

---

#### 4. Global Visual Consistency

- Apply the new gradient + lighter theme to all shared components:
  - Navbar
  - Footer (if present)
  - Floating Assistant Button container
- Ensure color balance across borders, texts, and shadows
- Add **translucency and blur** to floating elements if possible (e.g. glassmorphism effect)

---

### ðŸ’» Technical Notes:

- Maintain all navigation and routing
- Avoid breaking auth or plan comparison logic
- Test all screens on mobile (especially countdown + auth)
- Color contrast should remain **ADA compliant** where possible

---

### ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

- Fully updated UI theme using the two reference gradients as color foundations
- New icons integrated across category pages
- All shared components updated visually
- Verified mobile consistency
- No regressions in logic, authentication, or animation behavior

Please respond with a short summary of your understanding. Once I confirm it aligns with our goals, you may begin implementation.
