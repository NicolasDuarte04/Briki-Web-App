We are now initiating a **complete UI/UX redesign** of Briki from the ground up.

This is not an incremental update — we are fully demolishing the current UI to build something exceptional. Think of it as replacing a basic structure with a world-class digital experience. The goal is to create a platform that looks and feels like it belongs among companies like **Stripe, Apple, and Linear**, while remaining true to Briki’s mission of being the most user-friendly, AI-powered insurance marketplace in Latin America.

---

### CONTEXT

Briki is an AI-powered insurance comparison platform that simplifies the process of understanding and selecting plans in **Travel, Pet, Auto, and Health** insurance. It features real-time analysis, an AI assistant ("Briki Pilot"), and clear educational UI. We want the app to feel:

- **Elegant, confident, and visually stunning** for consumers
- **Sharp, high-tech, and insightful** for providers and partners
- **Clean and approachable** while showcasing AI, automation, and intelligence
- With subtle **animated fluidity and futuristic softness** (no rigid or boring sections)

---

### GOALS FOR THIS PHASE

#### 1. **Full Redesign of UI Base and Layout**
- Remove all current UI layouts, containers, spacing, font systems, button styles, gradients.
- Implement a **new design system** based on a Stripe-inspired UI:
  - Smooth **animated radial gradient backgrounds**
  - **Glassmorphism**, subtle blurs, and shadows
  - Clean sans-serif fonts (Satoshi, Inter, or DM Sans)
  - Fewer hard lines, more **floating elements**, fluid motion

#### 2. **Color & Motion System**
- Primary base: soft **electric blue gradients (#4C6EFF to #59F9F7)**
- Accents: bold but not over-saturated colors
- Maintain **white spacing** but make it feel alive and elegant, not pale
- Use soft **animated transitions** between sections, buttons, hovers, and loaders
- Background should gently move (e.g., subtle pulse, shifting color flows, or noise)

#### 3. **Redesign of Core Screens**
Start with these:
- Home Screen (marketing + CTA landing for users)
- Login & Signup (glass-style Apple modals over animated BG)
- Plan Explorer
- Plan Comparison
- Checkout
- Briki Assistant ("Briki Pilot") Chat UI
- Company Portal (for providers)

These should have unified styling, but with visual distinction between:
- **User side** (soft, gradient-based, encouraging exploration)
- **Company side** (dark, intelligent, more serious with technical elegance)

### ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

#### Briki Pilot Assistant
- Rework the Briki Assistant interface to look like a **smart AI agent**.
- Add **micro-animations** when idle or replying.
- Floating bubble icon with animation on hover.
- When activated, the assistant appears in a sleek, non-obtrusive modal.

#### Button & Input Design
- Ditch all current button styles.
- Introduce Apple-style shadows, **liquid-feeling hover effects**, and clear distinctions between primary/secondary.
- Inputs should feel like part of a high-end OS — minimal borders, subtle feedback.

#### Typography
- Use distinct weights and responsive scaling.
- Ensure **hero headings** feel designed — not default font styles.
- Use motion on value props, stats, or quotes to guide attention.

### YOUR TASK

1. Start from the **Home screen** and apply the new design foundation: animated background, updated fonts/colors/buttons.
2. Then rebuild the Auth screens, Plan Explorer, and so on using this new system.
3. Apply consistent **glassmorphism, animation, and spacing** across the app.
4. Refactor the Briki Pilot to feel like a real co-pilot, not just a support widget.

Please confirm when the new layout scaffolding is ready, and I’ll provide any visual assets, content copy, or layout guides you need.

This is our boldest UI phase yet — treat it like you’re building the **Stripe of InsurTech**.

Let’s make Briki unforgettable.
