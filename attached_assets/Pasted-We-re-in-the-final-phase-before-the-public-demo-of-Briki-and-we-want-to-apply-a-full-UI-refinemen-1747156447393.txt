We’re in the final phase before the public demo of Briki, and we want to apply a full **UI refinement and value positioning polish** to ensure the app feels aligned with our vision.

This task includes **design tone adjustments**, **icon improvements**, and **clear messaging** for both users and potential partners.

---

✅ BEFORE YOU START:  
Please summarize your understanding of this prompt in one paragraph and wait for our confirmation before beginning implementation.

### 1. Background & Color Tone Refinement

**Goal:** Dial back the current dark, overly futuristic style and adopt a **warmer, emotionally intelligent AI aesthetic**.

**Design Inspiration:**
- Reference the attached gradients: soft teal, indigo, violet blends
- We want to feel **calm, advanced, and trustworthy**—similar to modern AI interfaces like Apple Vision Pro or Humane AI

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use **light-to-mid gradient backgrounds** with soft transitions—avoid black or solid darkness
- Apply background consistency across:
  - Home page
  - Auth screen
  - Countdown page
  - Category pages (Travel, Auto, Pet, Health)

**Visual Balance:**
- Fonts should feel clean and slightly spaced (use letter spacing if needed)
- Shadows should be **light** or replaced with subtle blur depth
- Ensure hover states, buttons, and cards are easy to scan and aligned with the new tone

---

### 2. Icon System Redesign (Travel, Auto, Pet, Health)

**Goal:** Replace the current cartoonish or generic icons with **professional Apple-style icons** that match our new aesthetic.

**Requirements:**
- One icon per category: Travel, Auto, Pet, Health
- Use minimalist, neutral white or light-filled designs with soft colored outlines
  - Travel: Blue tone
  - Auto: Teal or mint
  - Pet: Soft orange
  - Health: Subtle red
- Optional subtle hover animation (e.g., soft scale or glow pulse)
- Make sure they feel **cohesive with the background gradient**

### 3. Value Proposition Display

**Goal:** Clearly communicate Briki’s dual purpose to users and insurance industry professionals.

**Where to Place:**

**a. Countdown Screen** (under timer)
- Large heading:  
  **“The easiest way to compare and understand insurance plans—backed by AI.”**
- Smaller text below:  
  _“For providers: A data-driven distribution channel + insight platform into real consumer behavior and intent.”_

**b. Home Page Hero Section**  
Replace current description with:  
_“Briki simplifies your insurance decision—compare, learn, and choose with confidence.  
Smarter for users. Smarter for providers.”_

**c. Optional 'About' or 'Learn More' Page**  
If this section exists, split into toggles:  
- “For Users”  
- “For Insurance Companies”

**d. OpenGraph Metadata (if integrated):**  
Use the value prop in the OG description for social previews

### 4. Final Polish Checklist

Please ensure the following throughout:
- Consistent color palette across all screens
- Mobile responsiveness preserved
- Text always readable over new backgrounds
- AI Assistant retains new subdued behavior (does not auto-pop up)
- All icons and gradient tones feel balanced from a UI perspective
