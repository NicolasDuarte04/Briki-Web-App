Briki App – Final Cleanup & Fix Prompt  
Goal: Resolve all known inconsistencies, routing bugs, and visual issues affecting navigation between /explore/* and /insurance/* pages to ensure a polished pre-launch experience.

I. Conditional Navigation Logic  
We need navbar behavior to change based on authentication status:  
- If isAuthenticated = true:  
  - Navbar links should point to /insurance/travel, /insurance/auto, /insurance/pet, /insurance/health  
- If isAuthenticated = false:  
  - Navbar links should point to /explore/travel, /explore/auto, /explore/pet, /explore/health  

Update target:  
- client/src/components/navbar-new.tsx (both desktop and mobile)

II. Fix SEO Metadata Handling in Explore Pages  
React does not support raw <head> tags in component files.  
Fix:  
- Use React Helmet (or equivalent) in ExploreLayout to inject:  
  - title  
  - meta description  
  - OpenGraph and Twitter tags  

Update target:  
- client/src/components/layout/explore-layout.tsx

III. Replace Misaligned Icons in Explore Pages  
Several Lucide icon substitutions were incorrect (e.g., using Cat instead of Paw).  
Fix:  
- Replace mismatched icons with correct ones  
- Match Briki’s visual design (Apple-style, clean, geometric)  

Update target:  
- All /client/src/pages/explore/*.tsx files

IV. Add Redirects for Legacy Routes  
Legacy flat routes like /auto-insurance or /pet-insurance still exist and can override/conflict with new ones.  
Fix:  
- Add redirects:  
  - /auto-insurance → /explore/auto  
  - /pet-insurance → /explore/pet  
  - /health-insurance → /explore/health  
  - /travel-insurance → /explore/travel  
  - /insurance-plans → /explore/travel or /  

Implementation:  
- Either redirect in router  
- Or create wrapper components  

Update target:  
- Wherever legacy routes are defined (likely client/src/pages/)

V. Fix Primary Button Variant Bug  
The variant="primary" usage in navbar-new.tsx is invalid.  
Fix:  
- Either use valid variant (e.g., "default", "ghost")  
- OR add "primary" to accepted variants in the base button component  

Update target:  
- client/src/components/navbar-new.tsx  
- Possibly your button component

VI. Summary of Final Cleanup Goals  
Ensure that after these changes:  
- Navigation is role-aware and consistent  
- Explore pages are SEO-optimized and bug-free  
- Icons are visually consistent and professional  
- Legacy paths no longer break layout or override new ones  
- Button styling is valid  
- Separation is maintained:  
  - Public users → /explore/*  
  - Authenticated users → /insurance/*  
  - Company partners → /company/*

- All items implemented  
- Updated file structure documented
