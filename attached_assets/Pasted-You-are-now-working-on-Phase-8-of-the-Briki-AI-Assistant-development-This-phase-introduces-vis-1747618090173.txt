You are now working on **Phase 8** of the Briki AI Assistant development.

This phase introduces visual explanation components — like glossary cards, tooltips, and visual diagrams — that Briki can use mid-chat to **educate users interactively**.

---

### Objectives:

1. **Build GlossaryCard Component**
   - Create a reusable `GlossaryCard` component for terms like “deductible”, “co-pay”, “exclusion”, etc.
   - Component should include:
     • Term title (e.g., “Deductible”)
     • Plain-language definition
     • Optional visual aid (icon or illustration placeholder)
     • Source or “learn more” link (if available)
   - Use Tailwind + ShadCN styling for consistency
   - Place it in `components/assistant/widgets/GlossaryCard.tsx`

2. **Enable AI Assistant to Trigger GlossaryCards**
   - Update the backend to allow OpenAI to return glossary triggers like:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "show_glossary",
       "term": "deductible",
       "definition": "A deductible is the amount you pay before your insurance starts covering costs.",
       "icon": "deductible-icon"
     }
     ```
   - In the frontend assistant logic, detect this type and inject a `GlossaryCard` into the chat

3. **Create a Simple Visual Explainer Component**
   - Create a second reusable widget: `VisualExplainerCard`
   - Use it for side-by-side comparisons (e.g., “Basic vs Premium Coverage”)
   - Include:
     • Title
     • Left vs Right table-style comparison
     • Icons or colored indicators for clarity

4. **Smart Rendering Inside the Chat**
   - Just like plan cards, inject glossary cards and explainer cards **inline** in the message history
   - Position them below the related assistant message
   - Make them fully responsive and scroll-friendly

5. **Test with Real Assistant Queries**
   - Trigger glossary widgets when user asks things like:
     • “What is a deductible?”
     • “Can you explain exclusions?”
     • “What’s the difference between co-pay and out-of-pocket?”
   - Use either simulated or live OpenAI responses with structured metadata

This phase equips Briki with **visual intelligence** — making it the most educational insurance assistant in Latin America.

Once complete, we’ll move to **Phase 9: Analytics + Interaction Logging** to start tracking what users ask and how Briki responds.
