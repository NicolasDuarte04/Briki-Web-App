// Briki Insurance Pages – Final Visual Fix & Wrapper Refactor

Please proceed with the final structural and visual fixes across all `/insurance` pages based on your latest analysis. Implement the following action items:

1. ✅ **Shared Wrapper Component Integration**
   - Apply the `HeroWrapper.tsx` and `ContentWrapper.tsx` components you proposed.
   - Replace the existing inline sections in `/insurance/travel.tsx`, `/auto.tsx`, `/pet.tsx`, and `/health.tsx` with these new shared components.
   - Ensure title, description, and CTA buttons pass correctly as props to keep hero sections consistent and editable.

2. ✅ **Remove Duplicate Layout Wrapping**
   - Confirm that `MainLayout` is applied **only once** via `App.tsx` (lines 149–155).
   - Remove any remaining redundant `MainLayout` imports from the page files themselves (e.g., previously found in `auto.tsx`, `health.tsx`).

3. ✅ **Fix Hero Image Visibility & Section Stack Order**
   - Ensure hero background gradients and images render correctly using z-index layering.
   - Apply `z-10` to hero content and `relative z-10 mt-4` to all following sections to prevent visual overlapping.
   - Maintain hero image consistency on all screen sizes, especially on iPad and iPhone.

4. ✅ **Add Scroll-to-Top Behavior**
   - Add `useEffect(() => window.scrollTo(0, 0), [])` to each insurance page to reset scroll position on navigation.
   - Prevents previous page remnants from flashing before full render.

5. ✅ **Apply Final UI Polish**
   - Normalize padding, spacing, and font weights across all pages.
   - Ensure:
     - Content starts below the navbar (safe-area spacing)
     - Cards have equal margins
     - CTAs are consistently aligned
     - Icon styling matches the updated Apple-style SVGs

Once complete:
- Confirm which files were changed
- Let us know if the wrapper components require props or conditional logic to work on all pages
- Let us know if any layout regression or scroll bug appears post-implementation

Thank you — we’re almost there!
