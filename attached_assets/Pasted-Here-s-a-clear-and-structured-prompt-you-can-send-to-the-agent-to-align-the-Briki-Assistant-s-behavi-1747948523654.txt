Prompt for Agent: Align AI Assistant Behavior with Product Vision

We’re ready to evolve the Briki AI Assistant into the experience we’ve just mapped out in our recent visual journey. Based on the vision, we want to guide users from a clear question (“I just bought a Vespa…”) all the way to selecting a recommended plan, with suggestions, clarity, and actionable next steps. Here’s what we need from you:

Objective

Make the AI Assistant replicate the interaction journey shown in our visual mockups and outlined logic:
	1.	Recognize clear user intents like “I just bought a Vespa and need insurance in Colombia”
	2.	Dynamically reply with:
	•	A short, conversational explanation of insurance types relevant to that query
	•	Three personalized plan recommendations with tags (e.g. Recommended, Budget-Friendly, Comprehensive)
	•	A CTA that says something like “Ver todos los planes” to take the user to the full plan comparison screen
	•	Optionally, a follow-up recommendation module: “Ya que elegiste este plan, también podrías necesitar…”

Implementation Questions

Please help us determine what we need technically to achieve the above:
	1.	Plan Integration: What backend adjustments are required for the assistant to retrieve real plan data dynamically, rather than from hardcoded samples?
	2.	Prompt Design: Can we structure the assistant’s prompt to return the three plans with our formatted visual cards, along with the CTA?
	3.	Widgets: How do we pass recommended plan objects to the frontend and render them like we do on the landing page?
	4.	Follow-Up Logic: What would it take to trigger the “También podrías necesitar…” recommendation logic based on plan selection?
	5.	Navigation Action: How can we hook the “Ver todos los planes” link so it scrolls or routes to the plan screen with prefiltered results?

Timeline

Start with enabling:
	•	Three structured plan cards based on user context
	•	CTA linking to full plans
	•	Inline short conversational explanations

Let us know where you recommend starting and what files or components you’d like us to focus on first. We’ll support with visuals and UX adjustments as needed.
