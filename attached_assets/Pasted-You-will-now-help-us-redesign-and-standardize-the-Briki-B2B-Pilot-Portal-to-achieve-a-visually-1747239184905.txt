You will now help us redesign and standardize the **Briki B2B (Pilot) Portal** to achieve a visually cohesive, powerful, and futuristic experience that aligns with our intended identity.

### Scope:
This redesign is strictly for the **Briki Pilot (company-facing) portal**, which includes the following files:

1. `company-page.tsx` (Marketing welcome page for insurance companies)
2. `company-login-page.tsx` (Partner login)
3. `company-register-page.tsx` (Partner registration)
4. `briki-pilot-portal.tsx` (Main dashboard/overview)
5. `company-dashboard-page.tsx` (Analytics dashboard)
6. `company-preview-page.tsx` (Consumer plan appearance preview)
7. `company-quote-upload-page.tsx` (Plan & quote submission)
8. `company-request-pilot-page.tsx` (Request access to pilot tools)

### Goal:
Create a unified, high-end B2B platform that reflects Briki's AI-powered, data-centric business intelligence. It must be visually distinguished from the consumer app, but still maintain brand consistency. The design should feel like a mix between **Cursor**, **Stripe Dashboard**, and **Ramp**, with smart animations, crisp visual hierarchy, and functional modularity.

### Global Design Requirements for These Pages:

- **Color System:** Use navy-based tones across the entire B2B portal.
  - Replace all purple hues with a new color palette:
    - Primary: `#003087` (navy)
    - Accent: `#0074FF` (bright blue)
    - Glow: `#33BFFF` (electric blue for lighting & outlines)
  - Remove purples (`indigo`, `violet`, `fuchsia`) from components, borders, glows, and text.

- **Typography:** Unify font sizing and spacing between cards, buttons, and titles. Ensure a clean visual rhythm.

- **Component Consistency:** Use the same card type (dark theme) throughout `briki-pilot-portal.tsx`, `company-dashboard-page.tsx`, `company-preview-page.tsx`, and future data modules. Avoid mixing light and dark cards unless there's a defined contrast purpose.

- **Shared Layout:**
  - Replace any remaining `company-layout.tsx` references with a dedicated and unified layout for all partner portal pages.
  - Ensure the top NavBar is consistent across all authenticated pages (use the one in `briki-pilot-portal.tsx` as the base).

- **Chart Style:** Charts should blend into the background using a dark theme. Use glowing gradients for active bars/lines and soft axes to reduce clutter.

- **Dashboard Animations:** Use subtle `motion.div` transitions when switching sections or viewing stats (already used well in `briki-pilot-portal.tsx`).

- **AI Assistant Section:** Should be retained and stylized consistently within the portal using navy tones and improved layout spacing.

### Visual & UX References:
Use these UI inspirations as your base:
- Cursor.com (hero layout, dark + rainbow glow)
- Stripe Dashboard (modular cards, clean fonts)
- Linear.app (modern spacing and shadow depth)
- Your existing `briki-pilot-portal.tsx` design (good base, needs refinement and unification)
