// Prompt for Agent – Briki Home + Explore Page Redesign

We're doing a full visual and UX redesign of the Briki homepage (`@home-page-new.tsx`) and explore/learn more screen (`@learn-more-page.tsx`). Please follow the updated Briki UI direction as seen in our current countdown page and the latest UI mockups.

---

### GOAL:
Deliver a consistent, elegant, animated user experience that:
- Aligns visually with the new `@countdown-page.tsx`
- Reflects our AI-first, high-trust insurance platform brand
- Looks like an “Editor’s Choice” App Store product
- Performs smoothly on both desktop and mobile

---

### GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use a **modern, Apple-style layout** with subtle gradients and soft shadows
- Use **Framer Motion** for entrance animations (e.g. fade in, slide in, pulse)
- Use **Tailwind CSS** with the Briki theme (light mode default, dark supported)
- Match the **font sizes, padding, and spacing** of the updated countdown page
- All icons must be consistent in **style, size (48x48 or 64x64)**, and alignment

---

### @home-page-new.tsx Redesign Tasks:

**1. Header / NavBar**
- Add slight `bg-white/80` + `backdrop-blur` on scroll
- Use animated logo entrance
- Improve visual separation from the page

**2. Hero Section**
- Add animated `motion.div` fade-in + upward motion
- Enhance “AI-Powered Insurance Platform” headline with modern font tracking and size
- Primary CTA: “Get Started”
- Secondary CTA: “Learn More”
- Add a floating gradient orb or blob in background (low opacity)

**3. Graph / Analytics Panel**
- Animate the bar chart fill with Framer Motion width transitions
- Each metric should animate into view on scroll
- Use color-coded indicators for Premium vs Standard Plans
- Style the container to match our card aesthetic (`GlassCard`)

**4. Features / Highlights Section**
- Real-Time Risk Assessment
- AI Recommendations
- Claims Automation
- Animate each card in with slight delay for scroll appearance
- Add subtle hover animation on icon containers

**5. Category Cards**
- Travel, Auto, Pet, Health Insurance
- Standardize icon sizes and spacing
- Add `motion.div` hover lift effect
- Use `Explore Plans` buttons on each with animated gradient hover

**6. Popular Plans Carousel**
- Make swipeable on mobile
- Add pagination dots or arrows
- Add subtle `motion.div` pulse or glow on CTA buttons
- Plan cards should be consistent in font size, padding, and spacing

**7. Testimonials**
- Show 2–3 at a time on desktop, 1 at a time mobile
- Animate entrance one-by-one
- Align avatar/name vertically with the quote for better readability

**8. Final CTA**
- Full-width gradient background
- Large heading like “Ready to find your perfect insurance match?”
- CTA Button: “Get Started Now”
- Add pulse or shine animation to button on hover

**9. Beta Banner**
- Convert existing banner into a **dismissible notification**
- Store dismissal in `localStorage` so it doesn’t return once dismissed
- Subtle animation on mount

---

### @learn-more-page.tsx (Explore)

- Same visual system and design language as Home
- Add Framer Motion entrance animations on section titles and cards
- Consider scroll-triggered parallax or offset motion for advanced feel
- Remove or consolidate repeated content (e.g. don’t duplicate testimonials if shown on home)
- All icons should match new system

---

### VISUAL SYSTEM REFERENCES:
Use same system as seen in:
- `@countdown-page.tsx`
- New background and typography from final mockup (light gradient, large titles, soft shadows)

---

### FINAL REMARKS
Do not modify the BrikiPilotPortal or any company-specific portal screens. Focus only on the public-facing user experience. The new version should feel cohesive, polished, animated, and ready for an App Store-level launch.

Let me know once complete so I can verify it against the new design system.
