Hello! Now that weâ€™ve expanded the insurance plan database â€” adding more providers, categories, and plan configurations â€” I need you to perform a deep, attentive, and structured diagnosis of the Briki application to help guide our next development decisions. Please do not edit any files yet â€” I only need your analysis for now.

âœ… Scope of Diagnosis:
	1.	Insurance Pages & Components
	â€¢	How are we currently fetching, filtering, and displaying plan data?
	â€¢	Are the current components (PlanCard, FilterSidebar, etc.) scalable to support the new dataset?
	â€¢	Are the filters, sorting options, and layout still optimal?
	â€¢	Are we using memoization or lazy rendering for performance?
	2.	Quote Generation & Flow
	â€¢	How does the /trip-info and /insurance/[category]/quote.tsx flow use the new data?
	â€¢	Does it handle new plan types and more granular coverage options?
	â€¢	Are we properly storing anonymous or authenticated user selections?
	3.	AI Assistant Integration
	â€¢	Does the AI Assistant have access to the expanded insurance plan dataset?
	â€¢	Is plan recommendation logic dynamically updated?
	â€¢	Are we using embeddings, tags, or score metrics to optimize responses?
	4.	Context & State Handling
	â€¢	Are our contexts (PlanContext, AuthContext, AnonymousUserContext) correctly managing dynamic plan data?
	â€¢	Are any parts of the state architecture brittle or hardcoded?
	5.	Performance & UX
	â€¢	Is performance degraded when rendering more plans?
	â€¢	Are current UX elements (loading states, pagination, filters) still valid?
	â€¢	What improvements do you recommend for plan discovery and comparison?
	6.	Architecture & Code Structure
	â€¢	Are there duplicate or outdated components?
	â€¢	Is our /pages/insurance directory logically structured?
	â€¢	Can we improve separation of concerns between UI, logic, and data?
	7.	Recommendations
	â€¢	Please outline what we need to refactor, optimize, or rebuild
	â€¢	Suggest any new components or features (e.g., best plan badges, dynamic filters)
	â€¢	Propose any backend API adjustments or caching if necessary

ðŸ“Œ Goal:

To ensure that the insurance exploration, comparison, and quoting experience is scalable, performant, and compelling for both public (anonymous) and authenticated users.

Let me know once youâ€™ve finished the analysis and send your detailed diagnosis and proposal.
