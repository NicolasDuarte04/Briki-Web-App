We’re at a pivotal stage and need to confirm Briki’s core technology is scalable, licensable, and genuinely valuable. Please go through the following questions and verify whether each item is already implemented, partially implemented, or needs work. Also note any structural blockers or optimization suggestions.

⸻

1. Comparison Page
	•	Is the /compare-plans screen rendering correctly across all devices?
	•	Are the selected plans loading as expected on page refresh?
	•	Does the design support 2–5 plans cleanly (visually and structurally)?
	•	Is the plan data passed through Zustand + persisted via localStorage?
	•	Is there a fallback UX for when no plans are selected (e.g., “You haven’t selected any plans”)?

⸻

2. Quote Flow (Per Plan)
	•	Does each plan’s “Get Quote” button correctly route to /insurance/[category]/quote.tsx?
	•	Are we simulating a quote flow using mock data, or is this logic still pending?
	•	Is there a way to trigger a quote summary popup or confirmation?

⸻

3. Data Infrastructure
	•	Where is the current insurance data model defined? (plan schema / mockPlans.ts)
	•	Is it flexible enough to support real-time API data later?
	•	How is plan ranking/tagging logic being determined? (e.g. “Best Value”, “Popular”)

⸻

4. AI Features & Smart Sorting
	•	Is the PlanCard component already wired for dynamic AI-based tagging?
	•	Is there any basic sorting logic in place (lowest cost, best co-pay)?
	•	Could we simulate AI insights with rule-based logic temporarily (until we integrate ML)?

⸻

5. Navigation & UX Consistency
	•	Is all routing now conditional (unauthenticated → /explore, authenticated → /insurance)?
	•	Are Explore pages totally decoupled and SEO-optimized?
	•	Are all CTAs redirecting correctly (e.g., from explore to /auth)?

⸻

6. Analytics
	•	Do we currently track user actions like:
	•	Plan viewed / selected
	•	Compare button clicked
	•	Quote request started
	•	Where are these events tracked? (Google Analytics, custom event system?)

⸻

7. Licensing/Scalability Readiness
	•	Is the comparison engine cleanly decoupled enough to license separately?
	•	Could we package it as a standalone component with theming and config options?
	•	What would be the technical roadmap for plugging this into an insurer’s frontend?

⸻

8. General Health Check
	•	Are there any known bugs, missing dependencies, or warnings we should address?
	•	Is the current project structure optimized for scaling (folders, layout, modularity)?
	•	Any redundant files/components you recommend removing or cleaning?
