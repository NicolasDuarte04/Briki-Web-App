Now that Phase 2 is complete and the Briki platform is live with dynamic, API-driven data, it’s time to move into Phase 3: performance, features, and UX enhancements.

🎯 Objective:

Make the Briki experience scalable, responsive, and optimized — both for users and for future development.

📦 Phase 3 Scope – Implementation Priorities

✅ 1. Performance & Scalability Enhancements
	•	Implement pagination (20 plans per page) on insurance listing pages
	•	Add lazy loading for components and images
	•	Virtualize long plan lists to improve performance
	•	Introduce caching strategies (React Query + backend caching where applicable)

✅ 2. Advanced Filtering & Search
	•	Add filters for:
	•	Coverage range (slider)
	•	Deductible range (slider)
	•	Insurance provider (multi-select dropdown)
	•	Tag/category filter (e.g. “for seniors”, “adventure travel”)
	•	Make the search bar smarter (match across provider, plan name, coverage type)

✅ 3. Dynamic Plan Insights
	•	Add calculated tags like:
	•	“Best Value” (based on coverage-to-price ratio)
	•	“Most Popular” (based on selection frequency or backend logs)
	•	Display plan badges on the PlanCard component dynamically

✅ 4. Quote Flow & Form Enhancements
	•	Link quote form inputs directly to available plan features
	•	Adapt quote form dynamically (e.g., toggle visibility for travel type, destination, duration)
	•	Allow anonymous users to “Save quote for later” with email prompt

✅ 5. UI/UX Consistency & Layout Improvements
	•	Standardize padding/margin/fonts across pages
	•	Fix responsiveness issues for tablet and mobile views
	•	Add visual hierarchy to quote results for easier comparison
	•	Improve empty states, error states, and loading skeletons

⸻

🧩 Dependencies or Parallel Tasks (Optional)
	•	Begin preparing DB schema for future PostgreSQL migration (if time allows)
	•	Start mocking payment screen flow and CTA for future checkout integration
	•	Create tracking logic for anonymous-to-authenticated quote conversion

✅ Please Confirm:
	1.	Does this Phase 3 scope align with your assessment of priority?
	2.	Are you ready to begin implementing the items above?
	3.	Would you like this phase broken into weekly deliverables or checkpoints?

Let’s lock it in and move forward with development! 💼🧠
