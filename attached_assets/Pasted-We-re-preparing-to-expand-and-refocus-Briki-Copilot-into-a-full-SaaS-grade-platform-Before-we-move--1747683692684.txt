We're preparing to expand and refocus Briki Copilot into a full SaaS-grade platform. Before we move forward with the redesign and implementation, I need a full audit of the current Copilot system.

Please answer the following:

---

### 1. Current Screens and Routes
- What are the currently implemented pages or screens under the Briki Copilot experience?
- Please list the files and routes associated with each (e.g., `/company-dashboard`, `/request-pilot`, `/company-quote-upload`, etc.)
- Which screens are protected by role-based auth for company users?

---

### 2. Folder and Component Structure
- Which folder(s) in `client/src` are dedicated to Briki Copilot? (e.g., `pages/company/`, `components/copilot/`, etc.)
- Do we have any centralized layout component (like `CompanyDashboardLayout`) for Copilot-related pages?
- Are any Copilot views still using shared components/styles from the main (B2C) app that should now be decoupled?

---

### 3. Auth + Routing Logic
- What logic is currently used to detect company/broker users and route them to Copilot vs the consumer dashboard?
- Are we storing company role data in JWT/session/localStorage, and how is it used during route protection?
- Does Copilot use a different login/register flow or share the same form with role detection?

---

### 4. Plan Management Features
- Do any current Copilot screens support:
  - Uploading plan data (CSV, form, or JSON)?
  - Viewing submitted plans?
  - Plan performance metrics?
- If not, are there placeholder components or unfinished routes?

---

### 5. Copilot UI and Design
- Are the current Copilot pages using the same theme and design components as the consumer-facing Briki app?
- Do we have a separate design language in place for Copilot (or do we need to define one)?
- Is Copilot mobile-friendly in its current state?

Please organize your response clearly, and let me know whatâ€™s working well vs what should be removed or rebuilt from scratch. This will help us define the structure for the new dual-model platform: public Briki listings + premium Copilot SaaS tools.
