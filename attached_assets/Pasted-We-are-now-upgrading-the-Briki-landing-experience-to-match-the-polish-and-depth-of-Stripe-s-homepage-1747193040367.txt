We are now upgrading the Briki landing experience to match the polish and depth of Stripe’s homepage. This is a redesign pass based on structure, UI/UX quality, reusability, and design consistency. Do not delete anything — just improve and modularize it using best practices. Follow these 3 phases:

---

## A. STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Feature Grid Component**
   - Extract the existing "Advanced Features for Smart Insurance" section from `home-page.tsx` into a new file:
     `components/features-grid.tsx`
   - It should accept a `features` prop with icon, title, and description and be fully responsive.
   - Add Tailwind motion and hover states similar to Stripe’s blur-card style.

2. **CTA Section & Beta Notice**
   - Extract the final CTA section into:
     `components/cta-section.tsx`
   - Extract the optional beta banner into:
     `components/beta-notice.tsx` if needed in future experiments.
   - Ensure proper use of props, animations, and reuse across screens.

---

## B. DESIGN SYSTEM CONSISTENCY

Please improve all animations, layout spacing, and visual consistency:

1. **Typography & Color Tokens**
   - Use `Inter` or Stripe-style modern sans fonts from Google Fonts.
   - Text gradients like: `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#667eea] to-[#764ba2] bg-clip-text text-transparent`.

2. **Tailwind Enhancements**
   - Use consistent glow shadows:  
     `shadow-[0_0_0_2px_rgba(99,102,241,0.25)]` or add `glow` class via Tailwind config.
   - All components should respect existing color variables (`text-primary`, `bg-card`, `bg-background`).

3. **Animation Guidelines**
   - For entrance animations: `framer-motion` spring easing, delay chaining.
   - Add hover transforms like `hover:scale-105`, `hover:bg-opacity-80`.

## C. LANDING PAGE FINALIZATION

Please update `home-page.tsx` (or `home-page-new.tsx`) to:
1. Use the newly created `<FeaturesGrid features={features} />`
2. Import and place `<CTASection />` after testimonials or plans
3. Add `<BetaNotice />` if needed
4. Keep all previous animation logic and visual enhancements
5. Replace any hardcoded sections with their new components
6. Ensure full responsiveness on all viewports (mobile/tablet/desktop)

Goal: The Briki homepage should now feel like a modern, high-end Stripe-level AI product. Once this is complete, we’ll apply the same treatment to other screens.

Let me know once you're done with this phase and send back the updated code for each new component.
