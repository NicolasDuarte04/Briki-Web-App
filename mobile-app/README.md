# Briki Travel Insurance Mobile App

## Overview
This is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo for comparing travel insurance plans. It features weather risk assessment, personalized recommendations, and seamless insurance purchasing flow.

## Development in Replit
Due to Replit's environment limitations with React Native and Expo, this project uses a special configuration:

1. **Web Version**: The app can be previewed in web mode using Expo's web compatibility features.
2. **Replit Compatibility**: Custom scripts are set up to run Expo in Replit's environment.
3. **Dual Mode Development**: The codebase supports both mobile and web views.
